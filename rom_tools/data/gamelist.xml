		<name>1941: Counter Attack (World 900227) </name>
		<desc>1941 Counter Attack is a vertical shooter by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990. The action takes place during World War II and depicts Capcom's own fantastic vision of the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player's mission is rather straightforward - on board a Lockheed P-38 airplane, he must fight his way through six varied stages, take down enemy installations, battleships and other huge rockets on their narrow launching pads. Unlike its predecessors in the series, 1941 Counter Attack traded the trademark and arguably monotonous level design for a more structured and diverse formula. Stages vary from an enemy infested canyon to city landscapes and fortified strongholds. Several powerups can be collected along the way, such as tiny wingmen widening the plane's fire power, or destructive special weapons such as laser beams and side rockets. The main weapon can also be charged up by holding the fire button to discharge a powerful attack. Finally, the plane comes with a small life bar and can be hit three time before being blasted into oblivion - this bar however increases as the game progresses, and is used to release devastating special attacks as well. 1941 Counter Attack also features a two simultaneous player mode.

		<name>1943: Midway Kaisen (Japan, Rev B) </name>
		<desc>1943 is a vertical shooter by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1987 (and sequel of 1942). The game takes place during World War II and is set in the Pacific air war theater. The player takes control of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning American war plane and fights his way through twenty four stages over the Midway Atoll, and the main goal of the game is to annihilate the Japanese air fleet and sea forces. The P-38 comes equipped with several forms of defense - a primary Vulcan Gun that can be charged up by holding the fire button, and a special power attack that can be unleashed in a blinding flash of lightning. However, the latter use some of the plane's own power - fuel is at the core of the gameplay and it depletes as the game progresses, or when the player takes damage. Power-ups are usually obtained by taking down formations of red planes, and they range from Pow icons (restores energy), shotgun (upgrades the main weapon to a weak spread gun) and double-cell (refills more energy). However, more weapons (such as a second spread gun, lasers, missiles and so forth) can be unlocked as the game progresses. Unlike its predecessor, 1943 gives the player the ability to customize the P-38 before battle and throughout the game - offensive power, defensive power, energy level, special weapons and special weapons time limit are all attributes that can be modified and improved. Moreover, special power-ups are hidden throughout the game, and although most of them give players extra energy or points, a special flower shaped power-up icon gives players the opportunity to further improve the plane's stats (a rare dragonfly icon also offers twice the number of power-up points). Finally the game features a password system allowing players to save their progress.

		<name>1943 Kai: Midway Kaisen (Japan) </name>
		<desc>1943 Kai is a vertical shooter and conversion of Capcom's popular arcade game originally released in 1987. This version was however developed by Naxat Soft and this port is essentially an enhanced remake of the original game. The action takes place during World War II and depicts the historic battle between the American and Japanese air forces in the Pacific. The player flies a Stearman biplane fighter plane and must destroy endless waves of enemy fighter planes, bombers and large battleships. The Stearman is equipped with a standard machine-gun that can be upgraded in all kind of ways. Formation of red enemy places drop special icons when defeated, and shooting at the same icons again loops through various power-ups and items, such as POW options (extra health), Shot Gun, 3-Ways, Super Shells, Lasers, Side Fighters or various special items such as the Double Pill (energy boost). The trademark Capcom special items are also scattered throughout the game, such as the Cow, the strawberry or the Yashichi (red and white twister/wheel shaped item) which gives the player an instant refill of energy. The second button is also used to release super-bombs that clean up the screen in exchange of some of the plane's energy, or make it loop in the air and avoid harmful enemy bullets. 1943-Kai features all the stages from the arcade game, as well as an original mode and a two player option.

Description from the USA back cover:
Conventional baseball no longer exists in the year 2020. The Super Baseball Association has been very profitable over the years with robotics power players up against the strongest of athletes. Due to the secret manipulation of certain robotics team players, abilities have been computer controlled to decide the outcome of certain games, benefiting the SBA. Die hard players discovered the SBA's cheating and have now disconnected several parts of the computers to achieve fair and challenging play. Now the games may continue in the famed Cyber-Egg Stadium where only power and skill will determine the winner!

		<name>Sankokushi (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Sankokushi is an adult Shanghai solitaire game. Unlike in a standard mahjong solitaire game, tiles are removed in groups of three.  These groups may be made up of three matching tiles, or the number sets, 1-3, 4-6, or 7-9. The objective is to find the four, three-tile sets shown at the start of the stage and remove them from the game board before the timer runs out.

When a tile is selected, other tiles are lit up.  Tiles within the number sequence are shown in pink, and matching tiles are shown in orange.  The player may request hints by selecting the help button on screen, which will light up all tiles that can be removed from the board at that time.  There is also a back button, which the player may select to return tiles to the screen.

The background image in each stage is an image of a girl.  Each girl has two background images, with the second image showing the girl topless. Once a player removes the four tile sets for the stage, the board is cleared and the player may see the entire image.

After completing a stage the player may use the points he has earned to buy power-ups, such as extra hints or a faster cursor.

The game is over once the timer has run out or if the player cannot legally remove any more tiles and the board is 'deadlocked'.  Upon continuing the player may select to play the same board or play a different one.

		<desc>Idol Janshi Su-Chi-Pai II is a strip mahjong game featuring seven opponents in eight stages (the final boss, having two costumes).  The player's character is Suchi-Pai.  At the start of the game, the player selects their first opponent out of the other Mahjong Pies.  The remaining Pies are played in a random sequence before moving on to the final three stages, all played in order.

As in the original game, stages are completed by removing all the tiles from a matching game played between rounds of mahjong, or by completely wiping out an opponents betting funds. Once a girl is defeated, the player is shown that girls strip sequence.

Matching tiles in the matching game reward the player with bonus items that are used to cheat during following hands of mahjong.  Some tiles are used to fill up a meter instead of giving an item.  Once the meter is full, a revealing animated sequence is played of a defeated Mahjong Pie, who then joins Suchi-Pai in assisting the player.

If the player loses all of their betting funds, then the game is over.

As in the original game, stages are completed by removing all the tiles from a matching game played between rounds of mahjong, or by completely wiping out an opponents betting funds. Once a girl is defeated, the player is shown that girls strip sequence.

Matching tiles in the matching game reward the player with bonus items that are used to cheat during following hands of mahjong.  Some tiles are used to fill up a meter instead of giving an item.  Once the meter is full, a revealing animated sequence is played of a defeated Mahjong Pie, who then joins Suchi-Pai in assisting the player.

If the player loses all of their betting funds, then the game is over.

		<desc>600 is your standard maze game (one of dozens released in the wake of "Pac-Man", with a few twists. The game begins by showing your turtle entering a building (a very early 'cut scene'), you are then presented with the first maze. Each maze has several boxes (with question marks on them), scattered around. You must open these boxes one at a time by walking on to them. Each box contains either an enemy race car (who will pursue you), or a 'KidTurtle'. The 'KidTurtles' are what you are looking for here. When you find one it will climb onto your back, and you have to take it back to the turtle house which will be located in one of the corners. After you rescue a few turtles the game becomes more difficult because of the amount of baddies that you will have released. However, you have some energy you can use to lay land mines. You can drop these in the path of a baddie, and cause him to freeze temporarily (you can safely walk over frozen baddies). A new game screen starts after you rescue all the 'KidTurtles'. After 8 levels you get to watch a small ending sequence, and then the game starts over with increased difficulty.

		<desc>Text from the USA Manual:
As the jammin' skateboarder you know you are, you've got to test your skills in the toughest course any skateboarder has ever seen. You start off with a hundred bucks in your pocket, your trusty skateboard, and the awesome moves you've learned along the way. Find your way around the park while dodging kamikaze cars, looney thugs and killer bees. You've only got a short amount of time to work your way through each one of the four levels, or classes, of difficulty. Show off your hot moves, and rack up points to earn tickets to the parks. If you’re lucky, you might find some loose bills lying around. Scoop ‘em up. You know you'd like to get the dough to buy those cool duds and some of that hot equipment.

720° is notable in that it is one of the first extreme sports video games. The game's name comes from the 'ultimate' skateboarding trick; turning a full 720° (2 complete circles) in the air after jumping off a ramp.

Ron Perelman holds the record for this game with 527,100 points on June 17, 1987.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Develop skill in using the rotary control in conjunction with the Jump button to do aerial moves, because they are worth more points. Press the Jump button after gaining speed, and then rotate the control in a 360-degree motion. In this game, it is possible to do much more than just a 360-degree turn!

* When attempting certain aerial or rotational moves, it is important to be properly aligned on landing, otherwise the skater bails, or falls down.

* To qualify for medals in the higher classes of skate parks, it is best to try to buy some skate equipment first to allow players to perform harder moves.

* Daring players should try to wait out the timer in the streets, performing skate moves and acquiring points until the timer is about to expire.

* In the ramp park, a good trick is to constantly push the kick button and do skid-outs at the top of each side of the half-pipe. To do this, get to the lip of the ramp, hold the stick parallel with the lip, and stop pressing kick. This will cause you to grind and skid down the ramp. You will be awarded big points at the lip and at the base of the ramp. This procedure may be repeated over and over for some incredible (effortless) high scores.

* Don't forget to visit the skate shops. Do not underestimate what a new board and shoes do for you. Buying new equipment allows you to move faster, jump farther, recover faster, and pull off more tricks.

* In the ramp section, levels 8, 9, and 10 : holding down the kick and jump buttons simultaneously on the lip of the ramp will boost your air. This trick only works when you're going the correct speed (usually your third or fourth jump), and only once (as far as I can tell) per ramp session per level.

* The entire game should focus around the Sessions skate park (the blue park in the right quadrant of the play-field). Making multiple passes through this park will greatly increase your scores. Remember to keep jumping and spinning. A good game should leave you feeling completely exhausted!

		<desc>Another 3-D Sega game rendered with their superb sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful jet fighter.

A number of colorful, fast-moving environments await the player, as he or she takes on the hordes of enemy planes intent on the player's destruction.

At the end of every 2nd stage, the player's jet fighter is re-fueled and re-armed, either by the appearance of a large support plane, or by landing on a military airstrip.

After Burner's straightforward shoot'em up game-play is unremarkable and repetitive, but fun - largely down to the game's incredible visuals.

		<name>Acrobat Mission </name>
		<desc>Acrobat Mission is a vertical shooter published by Techiku and conversion of UPL arcade game of the same name originally released in 1991. In the year 2100, humanity has to leave Earth due to the consequences of environmental degradation. Humans have decided to move to Mars and they left behind a bio-computer in charge of preparing the blue planet for future recolonization. But soon, an armada of hostile flying objects attack their settlements on the red planet. The defense agency decides to immediately assemble an attack force to neutralize the invasion - the operation, which is dubbed Acrobat Mission, is on! The player takes control of the 2TV-00836 Icarus, a fast space-fighter, which comes equipped with a Standard laser. Two more weapons are available throughout the game - the wide shot (W) which spreads out in front of the ship and the Hurricane shot (H) which fires clusters of rotating balls of energy. Holding the fire button charges up a special attack and each weapon features a different energy blast and damage factor. The ship can also hold a maximum of two smart-bombs, one under each wing - although they can be activated by the player, they also do fall off easily and can be detonated by enemy shots. Interestingly, the Icarus can't collide with other ships or any part of the scenery - instead, it bounces off and only suffers damage from enemy shots. However, once the shield is depleted, the ship will fly out of control for a few seconds and grant the player a last chance to inflict damage to any remaining enemies.

		<desc>Strap yourself into the cockpit and squeeze off heat-seeking missiles in this grittily realistic jet-fighter shooter. 

Sinister forces have melted the Antarctic ice cap, flooding the earth's cities. No one knows where they came from or what they want. But when the mysterious invaders attack Tokyo, you're called to lead an elite international team of pilots into the incredibly wild blue yonder!

In single-player mode, AeroFighters Assault features eight primary and four bonus missions. The game features four aircraft, plus two bonus fighters. Your enemies come at you in jet fighters, helicopters, submarines and frigates, guaranteeing endless wing time as you blow away aliens bent on world conquest. There are giant bosses, too! 

The action takes place over cities, oceans dotted with icebergs and parched desert. For pure flying fun, Multiplayer mode features a sky stage in which you run absolutely no risk of running into the ground. AeroFighters Assault supports full 360-degree action by allowing you to switch among multiple camera views at any time. 

The product of an unprecedented partnership between arcade specialist Video System and the flight sim masters at Paradigm Entertainment, AeroFighters expands on the traditional shooter by adding plenty of authentic touches. The Paradigm team logged plenty of wing time crafting high-tech flight sims for military pilots before helping Shigeru Miyamoto and his NCL team develop Pilotwings 64. With experience like that, AeroFighters is a first-rate flight sim, complete with a stunning flight-physics model and dazzling acrobatic moves.

A savvy veteran of the arcade wars, Video Systems made sure to pack AeroFighters Assault with white-knuckle action, especially when you're dogfighting a buddy in two-player mode.

Redrawing the intricately detailed fighters at supersonic speeds would tax most game systems, but the powerful N64 never misses a beat. The Controller's analog Control Stick gives you pin-point control as you bank, roll and plunge into screaming dives after your high-powered enemies.

		<desc>An overhead driving / shoot'em up game from Sega which borrows heavily from Bally Midway's 1983 classic, "Spy Hunter". The player begins the game riding a motorbike. In subsequent levels a sportscar, a beach buggy, a boat, a chopper and even a Formula-1 racing car can all be driven. All of the vehicles are, of course, fully armed to deal with the many enemy vehicles and gun emplacements intent on stopping the player's progress. The helicopter levels play as a straightforward vertically-scrolling shoot'em up and bear more than a passing resemblance to Namco's "Xevious".

		<name>Ajax </name>
		<desc>The player has been issued an emergency order. He must save the earth from being conquered by enemy forces. He climbs into his helicopter and prepares for intense aerial combat. Shooting oncoming enemy aircrafts and bombing the enemies below, he tries to make his way through the different stages to reach the enemy base. When he finishes the first stage, he is transported to his next mission by ab aircraft carrier. He hops into his jet fighters, tanks, ships, helicopters, and aircraft carriers. The player must also be aware of unseen enemies and surprise attacks.

Different kinds of power ups can be obtained throughout the game. These include:
'3' 3-Way: Bullets fire forward, right, and left.
'L' Laser: Player can shoot double lasers.
'T' Triple: Missiles are fired that spread out three ways in front.
'V' Vulcan: Rapid bullets are fired in the directions controlled.
'B' Bomb: Air to ground missles which can be upgraded twice.
'O' Orbital: A small drone using the same weaponry as the helicopter which can be otained by clearing a special formation of little red fighters.

There is an additional super weapon that destroys all the enemies on the screen at once. However, use of this weapon is limited.

Ajax contains 2 different types of stages : 2-D and 3-D. In the 2-D stage, the player controls a helicopter. In the 3-D stage, the player commands a jet fighter.

Ajax features some impressive graphics filled with rotation and scaling effects (some may get a little dizzy, though!), a solid soundtrack and excellent game control. Highly recommended for any shoot'em up enthusiast!

Also unique is that the game does not give a set amount of betting funds for each girl, because of this the player cannot progress quicker through the game by depleting the girl's funds and must play a match for every strip sequence.

Game description from the Tengen manual:
The year is 2089 of the Galactic Calendar. In this far-flung future, humans have colonized the outer planets. Without warning, the glory of this achievement turned into disaster: A horrible race of aliens has imprisoned an entire colony aboard its space ships! Each of these vessels houses countless numbers of slimy monsters led by a vicious alien boss. Having miraculously escaped capture, you must go from ship to ship in a valiant effort to save your fellow humans.

		<name>Aggressors of Dark Kombat / Tsuukai GANGAN Koushinkyoku (ADM-008)(ADH-008) </name>
		<desc>1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters.

The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as "Streets of Rage" or "Final Fight" because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the 'D' button, (Which many of SNK's other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A &amp; B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat 'em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special &amp; standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphically- after a while.

Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a 'Crazy Meter' at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the GanGan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US.

Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen.

The rescue chopper is under constant attack from enemy helicopters, while sharks swim in the ocean below and will kill any floating airmen they come across. Later levels also have enemy subs and ships all intent on foiling the rescue mission. Players must be careful to avoid the falling wreckage of any enemy helicopters they have just destroyed, and also need to be wary of hitting any parachuting airmen with their 'copter blades, as this will kill the airmen instantly.

		<desc>Arabian Magic is a scrolling beat-em-up for one to four players, set in the mythical world of The Arabian Nights. A long time ago, an evil wizard has taken over the peaceful kingdom of Shahariyard and used sorcery to transform its king into a Monkey. The player must defeat each of the game's seven Guardians to reclaim the 'Jewel of Seven Colours' and release the king from the evil hex. 

Each player can select from four distinctive characters: Prince Lassid, Princess Lisa, Sinbad or Afshael. Each character carries a primary weapon - Prince Lassid and Sinbad carry swords, Princess Lisa a magical veil and Afshael a mace. In addition to the weapons, players can also summon a magical attack in the form of a huge genie. The genie will only appear for a few seconds but during that time, players have control over the genie and can steer him towards enemies. 

Arabian Magic has seven different stages with one of the powerful guardians awaiting the player at the end of each level. Each guardian, once defeated, will drop a jewel which forms a part of the Jewel of Seven Colours. Guardians, once defeated, will join the player and become a Genie. Each level is littered with vases and wooden chests which, when broken, reveal treasure items and power-ups. 

The game ends when the player has recovered the Jewel of Seven Colours, saved the King (making him human in the process) and restored peace to Shahariyard.

		<name>Argus </name>
		<desc>Argus is a vertical shooter by Jaleco and conversion of an arcade game originally released in 1986. The players takes control of a space-fighter equipped with a front laser gun and ground bombs. Although the game features power-ups, they follow an unusual and unique formula - tiles on the ground must be destroyed in order to upgrade the main weapon or trigger special events. However, three of these tiles must be destroyed to activate such power-ups - B creates a temporary barrier around the ship,P upgrades the primary weapon and L gives the player an extra bonus at the end of each stage. Another interesting twist to the game is the Uoru armor; a shadow sometimes appear on the ground and if the player aligns his own shadow with it, then the ship transforms into a powerful robot for a short amount of time. Each stage ends with the same boss battle; a large Mega Argus fortress with a slow flashing core at its center, and the only way to destroy this pernicious mothership is to bomb its core when it is fully exposed. After the boss is taken care of, the player must successfully land on a runway and be cautious not to crash the ship. Argus features nine levels and includes a two-player alternating option.

		<desc>Area 88 is a side scrolling shooter by Capcom, conversion of their own arcade game originally. An evil general and his army are taking over the world and they must be stopped. A group of three highly skilled mercenary pilots who blow things up for cash, Shin Kazama, Mickey Scymon and Greg Gates, accept the mission readily. On board of their aircrafts they're now ready to defeat the greedy dictator and restore peace. One of the distinctive feature of the game is the ability given to the player to purchase new weapons and fighter planes. Right from the start, pilots are offered a F8E Crusader fighter and some cash. Then after each mission, the earned cash can be used to purchase new weapons or a brand new fighter giving the player a sense of customization. But there is a catch and special weapons and cash are lost if the player happens to die during a mission. Each pilot also comes with his own specialty - Shin, the young hero pilot, can level up the standard plane's Vulcan gun faster than his friends, Mickey, the hot-shot, can carry more special weapons and Greg, the veteran, has more health and can recover faster from injuries. The game is vast and offers not less than ten intense stages. It is however one player only.

		<desc>The 3rd chapter in Taito's legendary 1 or 2-player bat and ball game, in which players once again control a paddle and must try to rebound a ball into patterns of bricks to remove them from the play area.

Each level is patrolled by enemies and certain bricks, when hit, release power-ups which then roll down the screen and can be collected by the player.

While the 3rd chapter contains 50 brand new levels for players to fight through, the actual gameplay itself remains unaltered from the first 2 games. The only real differences are a revamp of both the graphics and sound, as well as a number of minor enhancements to the in-game power-ups.

		<desc>Armed Formation F is a vertical shooter by Big Don and the adaptation of Nichibutsu's arcade game originally released in 1988. The player takes control of a red spacecraft called the Vowger and fights his way through several stages made up of all kind of organic components. Tentaculous eye-balls and all sort of armed shellfish try to stop the player in his progression. To help the Vowger fulfill its mission, special power-ups can be retrieved from flying pods scattered around the game. They deliver basic upgrades such as speed-ups and, more interestingly, new weaponry. The list is actually quite large and includes side-bombs, laser-beams, homing-missiles and other colorful and flashy disc-beams. These power-ups vary throughout the game and each stage features its own set of weapons. Special flying orbs can be collected and have the ability to stay close to the ship to protect it. The second attack button can send them fly in formation for a short amount of time (hence the title of the game).

Improve your chance of survival by playing with an ally.  But beware of the deadly helicopter flying overhead... no place is safe frm this treacherous enemy.

You can select any of three game play options. They are:

GAME 1: The buildings are drawn in on the screen giving you a clear picture of the obstacles.  The joystick is used to rotate your jeep, but buttons 1 and 2 can also be used to fine tune your movements. Every time you press button 1 or 2 you rotate only SLIGHTLY to the left or right.

GAME 2: The buildings are drawn in on the screen, as in GAME 1. The joystick can be used to rotate your jeep, but buttons 1 and 2 can also be used to rotate your jeep freely to the left or right. There is no fine tuning feature in this option.

GAME 3: The buildings are not drawn in on the screen, creating a blind maze. The joystick or buttons 1 and 2 can be used to rotate your jeep, as in GAME 2.

Gameplay requires that the player initially pushes the joystick to the left, but whenever the computer opponent starts to act, the player must push the joystick to the right to counter-attack, and press the button to increase power. If the counterattack is unsuccessful, moving the joystick back and forth several times will prevent the player from being pinned. The player's opponent must be pinned before the counter reaches one minute, or the match will be lost.

		<desc>Ashita No Joe is a boxing game published by K Amusement and released in 1992. The player takes the role of Joe Yabuki and must fight his way through an intense boxing tournament. Seven opponents stand between him and victory and each pro-boxer is tougher to beat than the last. Two buttons are used throughout the game - one throws basic straight punches and directional button combinations allows Joe to use uppercuts and hooks. The second button puts Joe in guard and lets him block attacks. Life bars on top of the screen display the players current status and the winner is decided through Knock Out on the third fall. A two-player mode is available.

This game uses a unique control method and uses 'Mode 7' background scaling and rotation effects like those found in Super Nintendo/Super Famicom games. The most interesting feature is firing 'catapult' bomb shots far away with the left joystick pushed to the left side and the right joystick to the right at the same time, while pressing the fire trigger.

An upgrade of this game is called "Assault Plus".

Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Namco Video Game Graffiti Volume 3 - VDR-5278) on December 16, 1988.

		<desc>...It seems as though you've been here before - but this time, it's much worse! The Asteroids are faster, the enemy ships are much more skilled marksmen than your first time through this galaxy...and what's this odd hexagon-shaped craft I keep hearing about? Asteroids plunge at you! Trapped in a gigantic cloud of asteroids, your struggling spaceship hurls towards its doom. You'll have to pulverize all the asteroids with your photon cannon to save your ship and your life! 

Rubble from an exploding asteroid bounces off your ship's hull. A glowing blur flashes across your viewing screen. So that's where the rubble came from! The asteroid was blasted by an Alien Robot Saucer! Alien Robot Saucers are also trapped in the asteroid cloud. And they fire at you! You know that the metal in your ship's hull will register on their target finders before the asteroids do. The saucers could be a worse danger than the asteroids! More rubble strikes your ship. Its hull rings like a bell. If you don't get busy, that could be your death knell!

		<name>Asteroids (rev 4) </name>
		<desc>Asteroids is a legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre-defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a spaceship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins. 

Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds. 

As well as the ever-present asteroids, flying saucers also make a regular appearance. These move horizontally and diagonally around the screen, firing at the player's ship, and must be quickly destroyed. They are destroyed when hit by the player's shot, when hit by a saucer's shot or when they collide with an asteroid. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger. 

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart into two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat. 

Small Saucer - The smaller flying saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.

		<name>Astro Blaster (version 1) </name>
		<desc>Astro Blaster is a 1- or 2-player game in which players must advance through squadrons of alien ships in an attempt to dock with the mother ship. Players move their ship left or right and shoot at attacking squadrons. A special time warp allows the player to slow down the alien space ships and their laser fire, while maintaining his own ship and laser fire at normal speed.

As players go through the game play, each step is directed by the voice of mission control. Mission control keeps players informed of fuel status, provides a countdown on warp, keeps track of the number of ships remaining, and monitors the player's laser temperature.

As players enter each new sector they encounter a different number of alien squadrons. Players must destroy all ships in each squadron to pass through the sector. One squadron of rockets is extremely difficult to destroy, but players can pass through this squadron by hitting a few enemy ships. Once a player has destroyed all the squadrons in that sector, he enters an asteroid belt. He must maneuver and shoot his way through the asteroids to reach the mother ship. If fuel is critically low when the player enters the asteroid belt, he can receive extra fuel by shooting the red fireballs interspersed among the asteroids. After passing through the asteroid belt, the player's ship docks with the mother ship and refuels.

There are 29 different alien squadrons players encounter as they move through the different sectors. Every new sector increases in difficulty with different numbers of squadrons in each sector. Each alien ship has its own individualized sounds, movements and firing capability.

During their game, players must keep track of fuel consumption. As the player's ship moves through the sector, it consumes fuel. The player must ensure he has enough fuel to advance through the sector and dock with the mother ship. Extra fuel can only be obtained by shooting red fireballs or docking with the mother ship. The screen also displays the laser temperature. As players fire, the laser temperature rises. When they cease firing it cools down. If the laser overheats, players lose their laser fire until it cools down.

By depressing the warp button, players slow down the enemy ships and their laser fire while maintaining his own at normal speed. Players receive one warp per ships and are awarded one warp upon docking, if he has used his warp in the previous sector.

Each alien ship destroyed carries a different point value. Players also receive double points for destroying an alien ship when their fuel is in the red. To add further excitement, there are 25 tasks that a player performs during the course of the game and receives a secret bonus. Players do not know what these tasks are, but a good player will keep track. The 25 tasks are consistent throughout the game. Players also receive a bonus for any fuel they have left when they dock with the mother ship.

With a two-player game, players alternate at the conclusion of each sector, not after each ship.  Players receive 3 to 5 ships, which is operator adjustable. The game is over when a player runs out of fuel, loses all his ships, or crashes while attempting to dock with the mother ship. The top three scores are displayed and the game ranks players from 1 to 99.

PLAY INSTRUCTIONS :
1. Shoot enemy space ships for points.
2. Shoot fire balls for extra fuel.
3. Use warp to slow down enemy ships and bombs (only once per sector or ship).
4. Discover how to earn secret bonuses for extra points.
5. Dock with mother ship to refuel after each sector.
6. Game over when you run out of ships or fuel.
7. Laser will not fire while overheated.

		<desc>The object of the game is to fill the 7x7 tiled board with your colored globs. This is done by moving your glob adjacent to your opponent's glob and turning it to your color. 2 types of moves can be made during the game : first, placing a glob adjacent to one of your own duplicates it; or second, a glob may jump two spaces, but it will not be duplicated. The number and arrangement of obstacles in the playfield changes between each round, so strategies must be changed in order to accommodate these barriers.

Eventually, all the empty spaces on the board are filled, and the player with the most colored globs wins. In single-player mode if the human player wins, they must face a more difficult computer opponent in the next round. The game is over when time runs out, regardless if you're winning or not. You can 'buy-in' at any time.

		<desc>Avalanche is a 2-D game of skill. You control a multi-storied platform with a spinner-knob. Your goal is to prevent the falling rocks from ever reaching the ground. There are six rows of rocks to deal with. You start with a 6-storied platform and you lose one platform per row of rocks cleared. You score points for those rocks you prevent from reaching the ground. Of course, the farther the row of rocks, the smaller and faster they become. Your ultimate goal is to get enough points so that you can continue your game should you lose your first one. Get your hard hat out and prepare to catch some rogue rocks.

		<desc>The actual game has you piloting a little space tank. The tank and its turret are controlled independently, which allows you to move in one direction while shooting in another. Your mission is to guard various space outposts from hordes of incoming enemy ships. Each level will have several outposts all clustered together in the center. If an enemy ship touches an outpost, then the outpost is destroyed. You can activate a long range scanner by using your second button. This allows you to locate enemies before they get close, that way you can fly off and get them before they even have a shot at the outposts.

		<desc>This is an "Arkanoid"-type game with a few twists. Instead of controlling a paddle, you control the ball itself by altering its momentum using the joystick. Various blocks (squares, triangles, and special blocks containing powerups) advance down from the top of the screen. The player dies when the ball goes down through a hole in the bottom of the screen, or if the blocks reach the bottom of the screen. When you die, you start over at the beginning of the level. Although the game has a ball and paddle look and feel, puzzle elements come into play later in the game.

		<name>Battle Cross </name>
		<desc>Battle Cross is an intense racing game published by Imagineer. The goal of the game is to take a small futuristic air bikes and to go around one of the various race tracks. Unsurprisingly, players actually race each other to see who makes it to the finish line first. To spice up the formula, power-ups and weapons are available for the taking throughout the game. These weapons dramatically change how the game is played altogether - the laser is unlimited and can stun other racers for a short amount of time, homing missiles fly around the track until they hit an unfortunate racer, invincibility gets the player to knock out anyone in its path, land mines, nitro speed boosts and so forth... A little fairy flies around each track and can relieve a player gone bad. Various hazards are also scattered around each track, from puddles to speed bumps, pinball bumpers and even cannonballs ! The game also features a battle mode where up to five players can race each other up and a solo story mode.

		<name>Bigfoot Bonkers </name>
		<desc>This game was 2-player only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players mouse (the games promotional material said the character was a mouse), will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their mouse around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. Scattered around the gameboard are several 'fee' that you must avoid, as hitting a foot is just like smashing into a wall or a line. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). One good strategy is to try and box your opponent in to a small section of the screen, and then just move carefully until they crash. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own line, so avoid that at all cost.

These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once an enemy has fallen into a hole, the player must then use the hammer on the enemy to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit, which can then be collected. This game is a reworking of the 1980 classic, "Space Panic".

		<desc>1000 per word to have the compression done, so we tried to come up with a limited vocabulary which could be rearranged and reused as much as possible.There was some guy up in Silicon Gulch who did this stuff for a living - so it is possible to make money while talking in a monotone.".

The Artist Richard D. James, using his alter ego Caustic Window, has the sample : 'Humanoid must not escape' from this game in his song with the same name as the sample. It's from the album 'Caustic Window Compilation'.

Berzerk was also the first game to attempt a bit of on-screen comedy. Your robot opponents often fell foul of slapstick misfortune, shooting each other in the head or walking into walls and exploding in their attempts to kill you. And if you legged it out of a room without killing them all, the survivors would taunt you in their Speak &amp; Spell voices : "Chicken! Fight like a robot!". Okay, it's not hilarious, but even Bob Monkhouse had to start somewhere. Sometimes when you escape as above, it will just utter "Chicken".

'Evil Otto' was named for 'Dave Otto', who worked for Dave Nutting's Arcade Engineering group as R &amp; D director at the time Alan McNeil did. 'Evil Otto' can be considered one of the most intimidating video game villains of all time. He is, and even travels through walls, preventing a player from loafing in the room. He resembles a bouncing smiley face, and has been called a 'Malicious basketball' by some.

Berzerk was Stern's first major video game success. It was made in both upright (approx. 37500 units) and cocktail (approx. 1200 units) models. Berzerk suffered a bit in sales due to frequent breakdowns of it's original giant sized optical 8-way joystick. Approximately 4200 orders were canceled by distributors and operators whose machines were frequently down from the opto-stick. Stern issued free WICO leaf switch sticks to operators after they had so much trouble with the optical stick, but this still hurt sales.

Berzerk shares a rather chilling distinction of being the first known game to be blamed for an actual player's death. In January 1981, Jeff Dailey was the first person to die playing a video game, a 19-year old Berzerk player, died of a massive heart attack right after playing his favorite game. His score was 16,660 (a very respectable score but disturbing for obvious reasons). On an equally distressing note, in October 1982 at the 'Friar Tuck Game Room' in Calumet City, Illinois : 18-year old Peter Burkowski, a physically healthy person who was alcohol-free and drug-free, inscribed his initials in Berzerk's top ten list twice in a matter of only 15 minutes. A few seconds after that, he collapsed and died of a heart attack.
In Retrogamer Issue #47, Alan McNeil addressed these legends, and has a different perspective: "...one player did die while playing the game (Alan refutes reports that claim two died). The unfortunate fellow was obese and had run upstairs to play the game", Alan explains: "The legend is he set a high score and died, but the owner of the arcade said he didn’t finish the game – he was out of breath from the moment he arrived until he dropped. The legend is way better than reality: the excitement of playing a game killing a player after setting a high score..."

Steve Wagner holds the official record for this game on the 'Fast Bullets' setting with 350340 points on March 12, 2009.
Phil Younger holds the official record for this game on the 'Slow Bullets' setting with 304570 points on August 12, 2007.

A Berzerk unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.
A Berzerk unit appears in the ZZ Top music video 'Legs'.

Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983. 'Can You Survive the Frenzied Attack of the Robot Army?' In this board game version, 2 players face off. One player controls the Humanoid and the other player controls Evil Otto and the robots. Players alternate sides for a maximum of three rounds or until both have been zapped three times and destroyed as the Humanoid. Humanoid lives are represented by chips placed in front of the player. Each time a player's Humanoid is zapped, the player surrenders one chip. Once a player loses all three chips, that player's Humanoid is destroyed, and therefore he/she cannot control the Humanoid for the rest of the game. The object of the game is to zap more robots while controlling the Humanoid than your opponent.

Berzerk inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Goin' Berzerk' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album, here are the full lyrics! :

Humanoid - This is you.  
You can move in eight directions.
Once you start you're never done.
You can go from room to room,
You can crawl or you can run.
You can wander through the maze.
It's a wonderland at night,
You can stop and aim your gun when,
there's a robot in your sights.

Robots - The various colored robots.
I think I'm going berzerk.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I'm getting lost in the shuffle.
It happens every time.
I think I'm going berzerk.
Would you like to come to?
I can't stop now - I'm addicted!
I'm berzerk over you.

Evil Otto - The bouncing smiley face.
If we fight this thing together
there's a chance that we might win.
Now here comes Evil Otto,
push the fire buttons in.
I'm sure he's crazy too because 
he's bouncing off the floor.
There's no way to destroy him , 
let him bounce right out the door.

The speech, 'Humanoid' and 'Intruder Alert!' featured heavily in 1988's seminal UK Acid track, 'Stakker Humanoid' by later Future Sound of London member Brian Dougans. His use of distortion and slightly lower pitch, leaves the game sounding quite tame by comparison...

		<desc>Big Twin is a simple arcade puzzle game in which different coloured spheres continually drop down into the playfield and must be removed as quickly as possible. This is achieved by aligning three or more of the same colour, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. 

Once a sphere has completed its drop into the playfield - and providing it's not blocked in by another sphere - it can be highlighted and dragged to another position. 

As with several other Playmark games, Big Twin is of an adult nature and as the player removes the spheres, a picture of a naked woman is gradually revealed. The game ends if the stacked spheres reach the top of the playfield.

		<name>Biomechanical Toy (Ver. 1.0.1885) </name>
		<desc>Biomechanical Toy is a colourful eightway-scrolling platform game set in a world of magically animated toys. The magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil 'Scrubby' - a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge.

Evil toys now patrol the kingdom and must be destroyed or avoided. Good toys have been trapped throughout the levels and if freed by Inguz, will give help by providing additional firepower for a short time.

Inguz carries a basic, single-firing gun, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun's current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack.

Inguz begins each stage (and each new life) with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will boost the health meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen, or running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.

Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, the player will restart at the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz's face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot.

An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level's platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen.

The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game "Missile Command". This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The player's bioship can also collect power-ups to grow bigger (becoming more powerful), and can acquire spherical pods which attach to the ship and increase its firepower.

		<desc>Raguy is an environmentally-themed side-scrolling platform game for one or two players. 

The player controls a heroic young man named 'Blue' (in the two-player game the second player controls 'Princess Fa', who has identical powers to Blue), whose peaceful home planet of 'Raguy' has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and it falls on Blue and the Princess to stop them and save Raguy. 

Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf. Once stunned, they can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while shrunk. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at the enemies. 

Flowers, bonus items and power-ups are littered throughout the levels. The flowers are the game's form of currency and can be used in the shops that are located throughout the game. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and help with overcoming certain obstacles, or health and weapon power-ups.

		<name>Black Dragon (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Black Dragon is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a fantasy world and is the spiritual successor to the Capcom classic, "Makaimura" ("Ghosts'n' Goblins" outside Japan).

The player takes on the role of a barbarian hero who must jump and fight his way through a variety of colourful, enemy-packed levels, collecting treasure and weapon power-ups and rescuing the trapped 'wise old men' that litter the levels. 

Rescuing the wise men sees the player awarded 'Zeny coins'; these are the game's currency and allow the player to buy such items as weapon and armour upgrades, keys for treasure chests, anti-poisoning potions and health potions from the shops that appear on each level. Occasionally, a rescued wise man will also offer to sell the player weapon and armour power-ups. 

The barbarian hero is armed with a spiked mace on the end of a long chain, as well as unlimited throwing daggers. Both these and the armour worn by the barbarian (which offers limited protection from enemy attacks) can be upgraded by finding or buying the relevant power-ups.

The sprawling, eight-way scrolling levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage and reward exploration. These bonuses are in the form of weapon and armour power-ups, as well as valuable treasure items. Many levels also include a hidden dungeon and each dungeon is filled with both bonus items and trapped wise men.

Special items that reveal coins, upgraded armour, or simply bonus points can be found by attacking certain walls.

		<desc>This game was two player only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players character will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). The game ended after one player chalked up six wins, but this was operator adjustable down to as low as three.

Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Block - BLOODSTORM VERSION X.XX

* Fight Against Hidden Agents :
1) GOLEM : In Subterra (the background with the cliffs on either side), there is a spike hanging down from the ceiling, suspended over the cliff. If you can knock down the spike, it falls into the pit. Then you just jump into the pit and you will not get spiked, you will stand on top of the fallen spike and enter through the door! To knock down the spike, you need to hit it twice with either your gauntlet or a projectile. Simply jump into the air and do the normal gauntlet throw move or whatever your projectile move is.
2) DIMENTHIA : In the Obsel desert, on the ground, amidst all those symbols, there is a circular figure with five lines in it, like dividing a pie into five even wedges. Once the round begins, throw your gauntlet. You can jump and ditch it away, even. You won't need it. Move to the circular figure and do the move to pick up the gauntlet. The character will bend down and touch the ground. When the character touches the circular figure, a portal is activated and the character is transported to Triax, to fight Dimentia.
3) CRANIAC : You get to him from the Black Armada background (This background is the one with a catwalk in the distance). Getting to the back platform is the key. Hold Block and move Up 2 or 3 times to jump back to the far away platform. Moving left or right makes you switch sides, down keeps you still and up or center makes you come right back to the front. To get to Craniac, jump back to the platform 3 times and hold down each time you get back there, in order to get as much time back there as possible. 5 seconds after returning from the third trip, a small Craniac will fly onto the platform. While he is there, jump back there again to be with him, holding down to wait there. The game will freeze and a message will come up stating that you will fight Craniac!
4) WRAITH : he is found from the Scorch HQ background. You get to Wraith by entering a 'trash talk' password after you win a match on this background. The password is UP(x3), Block. If it done correctly, 'WRAITH SUMMONED' appears on the screen.
5) RATCHET : On Nimbus, note the far left side of the platform... there is a line that separates the small edge part from the rest of the platform. This is the key. On the winning round, you must defeat the opponent so that either you or your opponent stays fully to the left of the line, in the edge part. Then, you enter a 'trash-talk' code : Hold Left, then Front Leg(x4), Block.
6) SHADOW : Beat your opponent 2-0 from any background (no round 3 allowed, folks....without using the Block button in any match and do the fatality on BOTH rounds).
7) BLOOD : Blood, like Shadow, can be found from any background. To fight Blood, you need to have a perfect round and then win the match. Note that if you get a Perfect in the first round, Blood will not appear until the match (win 2 out of 3) is over. If you do this, the dead opponent explodes and Blood comes alive!
8) SIN : Beat all of the 8 regular fighters.

* SPECIAL Ending : When you have beaten all of the regular fighters and all of the hidden agents, you will get to see the credits and at the end of the credits, a code and a telephone number is given to you :).

		<desc>The object of BLUEPRINT is to accumulate points by finding the parts of your contraption hidden within each neighborhood and successfully placing them in their propper positions on the blueprint for the contraption. Once the contraption is rebuilt, players must use it to stop the persuit of Daisy Damsel by Ollie Ogre. By doing so they will score bonus points and uncover clues to the hidden Password.

In BLUEPRINT, you play the part of our gallant hero. You begin each game with three lives. The solid squares on the bottom of your screen indicate how many of your lives are left.

Use your Joystick Controller to enter each neighborhood you encounter and to move from house to house. Hold the Joystick with the red button to your upper left toward the screen. As you search for the parts to fit the blueprint, the red button acts as your speed control. Once your completed contraption is activated, however, the red button becomes your triggering device, enabling you to fire off a shot at meen old Ollie Ogre.

After having saved Daisy for the third time you will be awarded one extra life for being a true hero!

		<desc>This game is a bootleg of "Bubble bobble". Unlike the original game: 
* The left player ('Bub') can have only a total of two extends. 
* This bootleg has a new feature in Dip switch where you may control the speed of monsters. 
* The monsters 'Mighta', 'Hidegonsu', and 'Drunk' do not throw their projectile weapons (i.e. 'Mighta' does not throw his slow-moving stone balls, 'Hidegonsu' does not throw his fast-moving fireballs, and 'Drunk' does not throw his boomerang bottles). However, the 'Invader' monster, who appears in 'Normal' mode only, does throw his laser projectile.

		<name>Boot Hill </name>
		<desc>A classic 1 or 2-player western gunfight game, featuring a monochrome display overlaid via mirror onto back-lit plastic background. Each player uses a small joystick to move their cowboy up and down the play area, while a second, much larger joystick is used to aim the pistol and shoot - this larger stick also has a trigger button. The game's single goal is simply to shoot the other player, who is situated on the opposite side of the game area. Wagons and cacti litter the middle of the play area, providing temporary cover from the opponent's gunfire (while, of course, providing the opponent with cover from the PLAYER'S shots). These obstacles slowly disintegrate as they are shot; much like the shields in Taito's "Space Invaders".

Boot Hill is time-based NOT life based, with the factory default set at ninety seconds. This is, of course, operator adjustable via the dip settings. The computer opponent is quite easy to beat with a little practice, but a human opponent provides a much stronger challenge.

		<name>Bowl-O-Rama </name>
		<desc>This game has 3 different bowling variations to choose from 'Regulation Bowling', 'Flash-O-Matic', and 'BlackJack' :

* In 'Regulation Bowling' the rules and scoring are just like real bowling, following the regulations of the American Bowling Congress (ABC). In all three games players can join in at any time during the first frame.

* 'Flash-O-Matic' is a variation on the bowling theme. In this game a flashing score value moves back and forth across the alley. The player bowls, and the score value stops when the ball first hits a pin. If the player throws a strike he receives that score value. If he gets a spare he gets half the original value. If he fails to convert the spare then he gets 1 point for each pin that he did knock down. Scores can go up to nearly 10,000 points!

* In 'BlackJack' each player gets up to 3 throws to attempt to knock down 21 pins. Each time the full rack of ten pins is set. All pins knocked down by all players in one frame are added to the pot. The player who gets closest to 21 without going over gets all the points in the pot, and the pot is cleared to zero for the next frame. If a player gets 21 exactly then he gets twice the value in the pot. If 2 or more players tie in a frame they each get the points from the pot (or twice the points if they each have 21). Players who do not get closest to 21 or who bust (go over 21) get no points for the frame. Knocking down one pin scores as an ace, and is worth one or eleven, depending on what the player needs. his game is best played by several players together. The more players, the more points each frame is worth!

		<name>Kyohkoh-Toppa (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Kyohkoh-Toppa is a horizontally scrolling shoot'em up in which the player drives an armoured car, equipped with a front-mounted gun and super jump capability. The aim of the game is to fight through five enemy-controlled zones to retrieve a stolen top-secret fighter plane, the PK430.

The game's levels force-scroll from right to left, although the vehicle's speed - and rate of scrolling - can be slowed down and speeded up to some degree. As well as a forward-firing gun, the car can be made to jump huge distances. This is necessary to avoid background obstacles such as rock falls and broken bridges. It can also be used to avoid incoming enemy fire and vehicles. Land mines also litter the levels and need to be shot or avoided.

Kyohkoh-Toppa consists of five stages: Mountain, Bridge, Prairie, City and Airfield.

		<name>Bubble Memories: The Story Of Bubble Bobble III (Ver 2.3J 1996/02/07) </name>
		<desc>The third and final arcade outing for Bub and Bob (not counting the 'Puzzle Bobble' series), Bubble Memories returns once more to the classic, single-screen gameplay of the series' legendary first outing. Graphically, the game is very similar to 'Bobble Bobble II', released a year earlier; the only real visual difference between the two is the latter game's use of some rather charmless digitized animal photographs that form the game's backdrops.

One new gameplay addition, however, is the introduction of 'Super Bubbles'; There are now two sizes of bubble. Hold down the bubble button for about 1 second until you glow to produce a giant bubble. This giant bubble can trap either a single large enemy, or several smaller enemies. This replaces the 'Multiple Bubble' facility of the previous game in the series; 'Bubble Bobble II'.

		<name>Battle Zone (cocktail) </name>
		<desc>Battlezone is a classic one-player first person 3-D wire frame shoot-em-up in which the player controls a tank patrolling a dangerous war zone. Set in a valley surrounded by mountains, the aim is to destroy as many enemy tanks as possible, while avoiding return fire and destroying or avoiding the homing missiles that occasionally appear.

Enemy tanks come in two varieties; standard slow-moving tanks and fast-moving 'Super Tanks'. A single hit taken from either an enemy tank or homing missile will result in the loss of a player tank. A flying saucer also occasionally appears but does not attack the player and can be either ignored or destroyed for bonus points.

A radar screen at the top of the play area shows the current position of any enemy tanks or missiles within range, and the war zone is littered with indestructible pyramids and boxes that can provide temporary cover. Only a single shot is allowed on screen at any one time so accuracy of shots is vital to survival.

		<name>California Speed (Version 2.1a, 4/17/98) </name>
		<desc>No surprise here: Dodging freeway traffic is your biggest challenge in Midway's Golden State go-go Pak. 

"Why mess with success?" must be the mantra at Midway Entertainment, which has ported yet another arcade racer to the N64. 

Like San Francisco Rush and Rush 2, the action in California Speed swerves far into fantasy land. The Mount Shasta course spends more time in lava tubes than above ground and the Central Valley track concludes with a full-tilt dash through a (thankfully) vacant shopping mall. Most ludicrous of all, the Silicon Valley file terminates with your nanovehicle negotiating a jungle of diodes, chips and printed circuits. 

Longtime N64 players will recognize the whimsical handiwork of developer Atari Games, whose previous high-speed flights of fancy include the two Rushes. But while the earlier games challenged players to discover shortcuts and execute airborne stunts, California Speed is a point-to-point speed demon par excellence. 

While speeding through La-La Land, you won't find spectacular crashes nor the cheap thrill of turning around and ramming the competition head-on. Compared to the demented detours of the two earlier games, California Speed's shortcuts seem tacked-on. And there are no turbo boosts, no nitro boxes a la Beetle Adventure Racing, and none of the weapons that make S.C.A.R.S. and Penny Racers nonstop fragfests. 

Instead, your main challenge is to avoid errors at all costs. The field thins out soon after the start, so there's little of the high-speed weaving through traffic that makes Cruis'n World so exciting. Instead, you must elude oncoming traffic, which has a nasty way of appearing just as you're taking the inside line on a curve. 

You can also lose valuable split-seconds if you rear-end a slowpoke in your lane. Scraping a guard rail in the home stretch -- something the drone cars never do -- often means the difference between first and fourth. 

California comes with an impressive 11 point-to-point tracks, plus five hidden ones in such exotic locales as Fiji. The point-to-point tracks are long, easily lasting more than two minutes each, with checkpoints. The hidden tracks play much more like real-life race tracks with multiple laps, but have their fair share of split routes. 

In both one- and two-player modes, California Speed offers you a choice of a single race in a field of eight vehicles or a practice run, in which player-controlled vehicles get a free run on an open track. Both modes offer a choice of five circuits: 
Light - Default vehicles include a cool convertible and a golf cart that's zippier than you'd think 
Sport - Muscle-car city, plus your granddaddy's open-cockpit roadster 
Heavy - A big ol' Caddy ragtop, a low rider and a cherried-out pickup. Do good and you'll access the cleverly named Oval track and the busted-up San Andreas course 
State - Do the state with any of 10 cars, from light to heavy 
California Cup - The same 10 vehicles available in the State circuit, but if you fail to win, place or show it's adios 

The 12-vehicle menu has something for everyone, from a quaint but quick British roadster to a snazzy ragtop. The nine hidden vehicles include what looks like a New Beetle (all the cars are given fictional names) and a 40-foot camper.

As with the two Rushes, California Speed's graphics are wisely tuned for speed, not detail. The game drops nary a frame, even with eight vehicles on screen. The vehicles lack the detail of those found in Cruis'n World (yet another Midway racer, albeit one published by Nintendo). 

Fog is practically nonexistent when you're the human on the asphalt, but the developers had to cram in a bit more in two-player mode. There is no reflection-mapping on vehicle windows. Except for some pixilated trees, the landscape art looks sharp, if a bit on the simple side. 

Midway may have made one too many stops in the pits before rolling this one out. But if you're in the market for a racer with plenty of tracks and not much in the way of strategy, California Speed just might be your box of bolts.

		<desc>This game is like a crossover between "Arkanoid" and "Puzzle Bobble". You have a paddle and must shoot the ball trying to match with the same color balls on the descending balls. If you connect three or more balls in the same color they will disappear. After the balls disappear, any balls that become detached from the descending structure also disappear. Balls can be shot in three directions: 45 degrees to the left, 45 degrees to the right, or strait up. If you are in difficult situation, you can shoot a bomb. 

Once you clear a set number of disappearances, the stage is cleared and the player is rewarded with a digitized photo image of an Asian girl in her underwear.  Each stage features a different picture with a different girl.

If the descending balls reach the players paddle, then the game is over. If you continue you restart at previous stage.

Your goal is to get the highest amount of points (either against the computer or another player). You are allowed so many misses before your game ends. Misses are counted as the times you do not hit any rocks. The scores for the rocks are directly proportional to the difficulty in hitting those rocks. This game boils down to precision bombing and thinking ahead as to where the next bomb will fall. Good luck in taking out all of the rocks in the canyon.

		<name>Carnival (upright) </name>
		<desc>CARNIVAL is a 1 or 2 player alternate action game that simulates a carnival shooting gallery. The playfield consists of three target rows, a rotating pipe wheel, a bonus message panel, and a 'special' target block.

The player uses a left right control to position a rifle at the bottom of the screen, and a shoot control to fire the rifle. Two rows of bullets at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of shots remaining to the player. Every time the player shoots, one of the bullets disappears from the screen. More bullets are given during the first round than the others, so, the inexperienced player will have a chance to enjoy the play.

The game ends when the player runs out of bullets. This can occur on any round. A round ends when the player clears the playfield of all targets. At this point, a special 'shoot the bear' sequence appears, and when this is finished the player proceeds to the next more difficult (and higher scoring) round. This is Gremlin's Multi-Phase design concept that keeps games challenging to players of all levels.

When a player completes a round (ending with 'shoot the bear' sequence), the screen flips to the other player. When the original player resumes play, he advances to the next level of difficulty, exactly as he would have if the screen had not flipped to the other player. This method allows the players to more directly compare their scores, since they are always within one round of each other. Note that the player who ends the game first does not necessarily lose--he might still have the higher score when the game ends.

The three target rows move in a horizontal line from left to right (top row), right to left (middle row) and left to right (bottom row). There are five types of targets. The rows move as a continuous band--the targets exiting the playfield from the right side of the bottom row reappear at the left of the top row. The point value for hitting a row target is indicated along the right side of the game--maximum points for a top row target, medium points for a middle row target, and minimum points for a bottom row target. These values increase from round to round.

Rabbits and owls are simple targets, which disappear when hit.

Numbered sign targets award additional bullets to the player when hit, as well as awarding the points indicated for the row. These targets appear only on the top two rows to make them relatively difficult targets.

Five small letters, B, 0, N, U and S are randomly interspersed through the target rows. At the upper right of the playfield is the word ''bonus" spelled out is small letters. If the player manages to hit the moving bonus letters in order (b-o-n-u-s) a special bonus is awarded. The fact that the bonus is still active is shown by the bonus word in the upper right of the playfield. Every time a bonus letter in the correct order is hit, the small corresponding letter in the bonus panel enlarges to show that it has been hit. Whenever a bonus letter is hit out of order, the bonus panel disappears until the next round. The bonus panel reappears at the beginning of every round. The bonus value is determined by adding row target points into the bonus value. When the "B" letter is hit, the bonus value freezes for that round. This encourages waiting as long as possible before attempting to score the bonus.

Ducks are special targets. Whenever a duck reaches the bottom row, it is capable of leaving the row and flying down toward the player. If the duck manages to get past the player's rifle without being shot, it flies down to the bullet row and quickly eats 10 bullets. A maximum of three ducks can escape simultaneously.

The target rows move as a continuous band of targets, and no new owls, rabbits, or bonus letter targets are added once the round starts. 'More shots' targets and ducks are added during a round. The frequency of adding duck targets is tied to the round number. As the rounds get more difficult, more ducks are added as the round progresses.

A flying duck hit scores no points.

Bullets left over at the end of a round earn 50 points each.

The between rounds 'shoot the bear' sequence operates as a shooting gallery bear. Whenever the bear is hit, it rears up, roars, and continues motion in the opposite direction. Each hit speeds up the bear, and increases the point value, which is shown above the bear for each hit. When the bear leaves the screen (which it will always do eventually, since it speeds up with each hit) the between rounds sequence ends and a new round begins. As the rounds progress, more bears (a maximum of 4) appear on the screen simultaneously.

A special yellow-rimmed score panel appears in the upper left of the playfield, and stays on for random lengths of time. Four types of panels appear here, which either add or subtract points or bullets. Hitting any part of the panel border awards the score shown inside.

The bullet bonus panel is shown with a large plus sign, and a row of bullets. Immediately after appearing, the bullets begin disappearing fairly rapidly. When the bullets are depleted, the panel disappears. If hit, the player is awarded the number of bullets left in the panel when it was hit.

The score bonus is shown with the same large plus sign, and a score value. As with the bullets, the score value quickly decreases, until it hits zero and disappears.

The minus panels are similar to those above except a large minus sign indicates the number of bullets or points subtracted when hit. This discourages the practice of parking on the left margin and shooting--a miss will hit the negative target. These panels show a fixed number of bullets or points, and after a random time interval, disappear.

The pipe wheel contains 8 pipes of 4 different colors. A panel beneath the wheel restricts pipe hits to horizontally oriented pipes, and also indicates the point value for hitting a pipe. Every shot the player takes decrements the pipe value, except a shot which hits a pipe. This makes it advisable to hit pipes early in the round, when it is most difficult (since the player must shoot through heavily populated target rows). Hitting two pipes of the same color with two consecutive shots awards a bonus of four times the pipe value shown in the panel.

CARNIVAL is accompanied by background music. At the beginning of every round, the music begins at a slow rate and relatively low key. As the round progresses, the music speeds up and the melody shifts up in key. This gives the player a growing sense of urgency. As the round progresses, the playfield motion also gradually speeds up.

A small panel on the right of the playfield contains a musical note symbol. If the player wishes to turn off the music, he simply shoots the note panel. This makes the note disappear, and turns off the music. Hitting the panel again makes the note reappear and resumes the music. The note thus acts as a 'flip-flop' switch to turn the music on and off.

Every round begins with the music on.

There is a special case to consider near the end of a round: the player has cleared all of the targets except the ducks, and has plenty of bullets left so that he can simply sit and wait for the ducks. He would, in effect, prolong the game by refusing to end the round.

Theoretically, by hitting the ducks and 'more shots' signs, the round could be prolonged indefinitely. However, an internal "doomsday" timer in the game keeps track of how long a round has lasted. After a certain time limit (the same for each round), the frequency of new duck appearances increases dramatically.

The top 3 scores are shown during advertising, along with the player's initials. A player who scores in the top 3 is allowed to enter 3 initials by a special routine explained at the time of their writing. The rank is updated during the round. The player is both audibly and visually rewarded. There is a pronounced audible sound as the player's score passes that of another ranking player's score. And, they may watch their rank progress during the game.

CARNIVAL's basic play action is outlined below, as it appears in the game instructions.

Shoot all targets and pipes to advance to the next round.
Game is over when you run out of bullets.
Escaped ducks eat 10 bullets.
Hit B-O-N-U-S letters in sequence for special bonus. Bonus value stops increasing when 'B' is hit.
Hit same color pipes with 2 consecutive shots to score 4 times pipe value. Shoot number signs for more bullets.
Shoot the bear between rounds for extra points.

		<name>CarnEvil (v1.0.3) </name>
		<desc>CarnEvil is a rail shooter arcade game using a light gun. The game is set in the fictional town of Greeley Valley, Iowa. The main character's, Jacob (Player 1) and Lisa (Player 2), join a tractor-drawn trailer called Spooky Sam's Ghost Tour on its path through a cemetery. According to an urban legend, if a golden token is inserted into the jester's mouth on top of the tombstone of someone by the name of Ludwig Von Tökkentäkker, a haunted amusement park will rise from the earth.

Jacob leaves the tour with his friend, Lisa, and approaches the tombstone to find a golden coin sitting in a small hole on the tombstone, and surprised, Jacob inserts the coin into the jester's mouth, resulting in the legendary undead carnival rising from the ground. Jacob and Lisa take 2 [shotgun or shotguns] from the shooting gallery at the entrance and use them to fight through hordes of monsters, zombies, and insects as they escape.

First, Jacob and Lisa go to the "Rickety Town". There, they hop on the "Slay Ride" and battle several demonic elves, zombies dressed as goofy dinosaurs and flying bug like things and see Betty trapped on a ferris wheel. Finally, they battle "Krumpas", a Santa Claus like monster.

Jacob and Lisa then go to the "Haunted House" and battle through hordes of zombies, spiders, ghosts and bats. They notice that Betty is being chased by zombies. Jacob and Lisa enter the building and encounter Hambone, a large Jason Vorhees-like creature with a gatling gun for a hand. Jacob and Lisa defeat Hambone and proceed through the building. They find Betty being kidnapped by a Giant Spider upstairs and go after them. After going through "the hall of hands", Jacob and Lisa fight Hambone once again, who now has a skull launching grenade launcher for a hand, and is defeated again. Jacob and Lisa go onto the rooftop only to be pushed off by the car into a grave with a tombstone saying "Rest in Pieces". Jacob and Lisa at last fight "Evil Marie" who, after being defeated, falls on a tombstone.

The 2 then visit the "Freak Show" where they encounter Conjoined Acrobatic Men, Flies and Maggots with human heads, 8 legged monkeys, and a giant demon called "Eye-clops", a cyclops with more than one eye. They kill the monster and enter "The Chamber of Horrors", where they find Betty in a torture device. They leave to a Colosseum and fight "Junior", a Frankenstein-Like baby (or through the options menu, they can fight "Deddy", a disfigured Teddy Bear).

Then, they enter the Big Top, and fight clowns and circus animals to reach the center ring, whence they are taken to Tökkentäkker's zeppelin to face Tökkentäkker and his jester Umlaut.

After defeating Tökkentäkker and surviving the explosion of his airship, Jacob, Lisa, and Betty awaken a few hours later in a pile of leaves in the cemetery, and in front of Tökkentäkker's tombstone. Jacob then sees the token in its slot and, ignoring Betty's protests, puts it into the jester's mouth for a repeat performance.

		<name>Astro Fantasia (DECO Cassette) </name>
		<desc>This is a "Galaga" style vertical shoot'em up with a few unique twists that make it interesting. You pilot a single fighter ship against an armada of enemies (sound familiar?). There are 2 different play screens that alternate :
The opening screen uses pseudo 3-D graphics and has a large red bit of what appears to be machinery (or perhaps part of a very large spaceship) as background on the bottom half of the screen. You can move your ship around anywhere on the red background, but the black area beyond is off limits. The game opens with a large mothership craft visible at the top of the screen, but your shots cannot reach it at this point. Red UFOs quickly begin attacking you, swooping in line formations from the top area of the screen. They actually scale in size as they get closer to you (a nice effect for a 1981 raster title). By moving around you will discover that the screen can scroll upwards quite a bit, and the enemy armada comes into view if you get near the top of your area. The armada consists of several rows of ships in classic "Space Invaders" style, except for the fact that they are tiny. You can quickly blast the armada away, as you have twin shots on this opening screen, and you can have several sets of them on screen at once (it really only takes a few seconds to take out the armada). After the armada is gone, the mothership begins spewing out groups of red UFOs (who make suicide runs at your ship), and a new green ship that actually fires at you. Be sure and shoot these green ships quickly, as they split into 3 separate enemies once they reach your movable territory. Eventually the mothership will stop spewing fighters at you, and the entire screen will scroll up (taking you completely away from your red 'home base'), and the game will begin the second wave.

The second wave pits you against the mothership directly. You will find that your multi shot is gone, and you can only have one shot on the screen at a time. The mothership has 3 areas that must be blasted away (a 'spark' on each side, and then the center which takes several more hits than the sparks do). The mothership does not flash, or otherwise provide any feedback on a successful hit, but just blast away, and eventually you will get it.
After killing the mothership the game will award you bonus points based upon how much fuel you have left and then the game will begin again with increased difficulty.

		<desc>A solid and hugely playable sequel to 1989's superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up, Area 88. As with the original, players chose any one of three different jet fighters and battle their way through ten enemy-packed stages. Another idea carried over from Area 88 is the end-of-level shop, which allows players to buy weapon and shield upgrades for their jet fighter.

		<desc>Crazy Climber is a 2-D, strategy style game. The game is strategic in the fact that you must plan your moves as you climb up the building and anticipate the hazards that await you. You start out the game at the bottom of a building to be scaled. As you climb up the building, you will be assailed by bald people throwing flowerpots, signs with loose electrical wires, very large apes, falling signs, trash and barbells, and a bird that likes to drop bad things on your character. Your goal is to make it to the top of the building and catch the helicopter, which will transport you to the next building to be scaled. Of course, you will be rewarded for quickly making it up the building by getting a bonus (that is as long as you can catch the helicopter). The things one does for publicity.

		<desc>Strap on your vector spacesuit, and hop into your vector spaceship. It is a good old ship, and it has seen a lot of action. From navigating the asteroid belt and blasting aliens around the sun, to attacking evil space cannons, your little vector ship has done it all, and this time it has been upgraded with twin blasters. You see the ship in Cosmic Chasm seems to be the same spaceship that is in every vector game. You control it using rotation buttons and a thruster button, with a laser and a shield button thrown in for good measure, just like almost every other vector game around.

Now here is what you have to do. You guide your ship through a space fortress room by room. Each room contains a center section that slowly grows and will eventually trap you if you are not fast enough. You can shoot the center section to slow its growth. Each room also contains several exits. One of the exits will always spew forth a bunch of bad guys, shoot them, then exit to go to a different room. Between rooms you get to see an excellent tunnel animation. The idea is to make your way to the center of the fortress, blast the power core, and then leave. There is a map at the top of the screen to keep you from getting lost. This is a pretty decent game. It has a lot more to offer than the one screen of bad guys that most vector games have.

		<desc>4 billion worth of quarters now. It's still one heck of an industry." 

* Popular from the Start : The prototype games were hand-built, wire-wrapped, one-of-a kinds that were created by the development team prior to ordering the circuit boards for the mass-produced versions. With just a single machine, people would come in at all hours of the night to play a new game. 

Dan Plishkin : 'One of the things that kind of allowed everybody at Atari to have kind of a loose and enjoyable relationship was that management was kind of loose, too. An example of that happened with one of Howard Delman's games. I can't remember which one it was, but we sent the one and only prototype wire-wrapped version of Howie's game off to the AMOA (Amusement and Music Operators Association) show with strict orders not to sell it.' 

Of course the game was sold anyway, and a new prototype had to be assembled back at the labs. Dan Plishkin continued : 'Several months later Howie gets a call from the person who bought this game. It had stopped collecting money and he wanted to know how to change the settings to make it play longer, or something, to see if it would earn more money. Howie had to tell the guy that if it ever collected any money at all, it was a miracle because it didn't have any coin routines at all. It had none, because we had wired it for free-play when we sent it to the AMOA show!' 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Especially in the early 1980s a great many newspaper and magazine articles were written about the meaning of and possible consequences of the wave of video games that seemed to allure so many kids, and adults, to the arcades. But at the heart of it might have been the promise of a quick escape into another world. 

Rich Adam : "I kind of figured out, maybe years after the fact, what I think the lure of video games is. It's because people have so little control over their lives. This is especially true with kids, but even adults often have little control over the day-to-day part of their lives. You have to go to work. You don't get to control that much of your life. But for a quarter you can control this very complex machine. You can command it. For a quarter that's quite a bargain, to be able to do that for five minutes... When you're good at a game it gives you an incredible sense of power over the whole environment.". 

Centipede was the 1st UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) approved game. 

Jim Schneider holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 16,389,547 points on August 1, 1984. 

Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 7,111,111 points on November 5, 2000. 

Note 1 : The upright side artwork features a grasshopper, while it is not present during game-play. In test mode you can cycle through the different graphical objects used in the game (the player, a mushroom, a spider, a scorpion, a flea and a grasshopper). Grasshopper?! Yes, the game was to originally have had grasshoppers but they were taken out. You can still see them in the test however. 

Note 2 : 'Centipede' is also the name of a terrifying, man-eating monster of the size of a mountain. This Japanese legend say that the dragon king of that particular lake asked the famous hero Hidesato to kill it for him. The hero slew it by shooting an arrow, dipped in his own saliva, into the brain of the monster. The dragon king rewarded Hidesato by giving him a rice-bag; a bag of rice which could not be emptied and it fed his family for centuries. 

Centipede inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Ode To A Centipede' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including CENTIPED. 

A Centipede unit appears in the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", in the 1983 movie "WarGames", in the 1983 movie "James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again", in the 1983 movie "Joysticks", in the 1984 movie "Body Double", in the 1985 movie "Teen Wolf", in the 1986 movie "Running Scared", in the 1987 movie "Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown", in the 1995 movie "Species" and in the 1996 movie 'House Arrest'. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of twelve collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight". 

MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on Atari's Centipede. 

A Reimagined version of the Centipede franchise, was launched for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii under name of "Centipede Infestation".

		<name>Challenger </name>
		<desc>CHALLENGER is the newest video game to be introduced by Centuri. With its vivid colors and lively setting, it is sure to lure the most ardent player into game action.

The game consists of 16 sectors (rounds) of play. Sector 1 begins with Large Energy Rings floating randomly across the screen. The Spaceship must avoid colliding with the Rings, or it will explode into a starburst of brilliant colors. The Spaceship dodges the Energy Rings by moving right or left across the playfield, while bursting them with the Spaceship's 3-directional guns. Bursting the Large Rings (100 points) breaks them into Medium Rings. Bursting the Medium Rings (200 points) breaks them into Small Rings. Bursting the Small Rings (400 points) causes them to disintegrate.

The Spaceship is further protected by a feature called a 'Warp' button. By depressing this button, the Spaceship will relocate from the top or bottom of the screen to the opposite side.

If the Spaceship is in ultimate danger of being destroyed, releasing its Super Bomb will wipe out all the objects on the playfield, and add the point value of the objects to your score. Use of the Super Bomb is lost, if the ship is destroyed first. Only one Super Bomb is awarded per Spaceship.

At any time, a colorful Space Bogey resembling a Worm may appear on screen and proceed to chase the Spaceship. If the Worm is destroyed by Spaceship fire, or dodged successfully for several seconds, a 'clang' is heard and the Worm (500 points) wriggles off the screen in a bright red hue of embarrassment. If the Spaceship is caught by the Worm, a bell is sounded, and the astronaut is chased out of his ship in pursuit of safety.

At random time intervals a Bonus Bug will walk across the playfield, stop, and count down a Bonus Number. This number is equal to 100 times its value. To receive this Bonus, the Spaceship must link with the nose of the Bonus Bug.

When the Spaceship has survived 50 Seconds of playing time, it now enters the challenges of the next sector.

The remaining 15 sectors are played in the same manner as Sector one. The differences include that each succeeding sector increases in difficulty. The Energy Rings increase in number and move faster across the screen making them harder to dodge. Also there are several Space Bogeys introduced in the first 8 sectors. They also increase in number with advancement through each sector. Some of the Space Bogeys resemble Comets whizzing through space. Others resemble Spaceships from other worlds. Each Space Bogey (500 points), is an assemblage of bright colors, and when destroyed, burst with a "clang" into a spray of bright light.

Sectors 4, 8, 12, and 16, are alike as follows. A few seconds after the Energy Rings are broken into smaller pieces, they are pulled into a Black Hole in the center of the screen. While swirling across the game area, the condensed Rings expand and shatter into fragments which must be destroyed before they absorb the Spaceship.

When Sector 16 has been accomplished, it will return to Sector 9.

When Bonus levels are achieved, an additional Ship will be added to your game.

CHALLENGER INSTRUCTIONS
1. Burst energy rings to score and increase bonus levels.
Large rings - 100 points
Medium rings - 200 points
Small rings - 400 points
2. After all the small rings are hit, advance to the next sector.
3. In each sector, space bogeys appear and score 500 points when hit.
4. When the bonus bug walks across the playfield and stops, bonus points are counted down. To collect the bonus, link the ship with nose of the bug.
5. Pressing the warp button immediately relocates the ship from the top or bottom of the playfield to the opposite side.
6. The Super Bomb button destroys all objects on the playfield screen and awards total point value to your score.
7. One Super Bomb is awarded per ship.  Use of it will be lost if the ship is destroyed first.	
8. Game is over when all the ships have been destroyed.

		<desc>A colourful platform game in which the player controls a long-tongued chameleon that must make around a series of single-screen, platform-strewn levels; stealing chicken eggs from their nests and being careful to avoid contact with angry chickens.

As well as walking along the platforms and poles, the chameleon can use its tongue to pull itself up to higher platforms; and to escape from any nearby chickens. Each level also has a number of bombs placed at various points; the chameleon can hit these with its tongue to send them crashing towards nearby chickens. The player must keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by the chickens, such as flashing eggs.

If the nesting eggs are left for too long, they will hatch into a baby chick. The player can eat the chick for bonus points, but if the chick is left alone for too long, it will grow into an adult chicken and start attacking the player.

A level is over once all of the eggs have been collected and all of the chickens killed.

Now possessing superior physical strength and agility, Chelnov is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home, and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.

What distinguishes this game from others of its genre is its use of forced scrolling. The screen moves continuously from left to right and players must negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without the benefit of dictating their speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above and below and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies carry different types of weapons and power-ups and when they are shot the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.

		<name>Chimera Beast (prototype) </name>
		<desc>A horizontally scrolling shoot'em up where 1 or 2 players control creatures known as 'eaters' which are capable of eating other creatures and taking their DNA, thus acquiring their abilities or characteristics.

Chimera Beast takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by animals known as eaters, capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of evolution, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player's creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet's humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, will eventually make their way to Earth.

The chief innovation of Chimera Beast is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player's eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a poisonous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon.

Another difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player's eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well.

		<desc>Gokuraku! Chuuka Taisen is a very unusual, yet cute, horizontal shooter by Taito. It is the home conversion of their own arcade game released back in 1988 - however, this PC Engine version could easily be seen as a sequel (both games do share a lot in common but levels layout and the overall design are very different). The game features a boy riding on a magic cloud who embarks on a journey to free his cute friend. The poor girl has been kidnaped by some evil magic forces and was imprisoned inside a large crystal ball. Weird mythological creatures and other flying cakes and buns try to stop our hero and prevent him to reach his goal. Thankfully, formation of flying dumplings often hide power-ups which either increase our hero's fire power, get him to fly quicker or just make him invincible for a short period of time. Also, special cloud riding enemies are scattered around each stage and reveal magic doors when defeated. These doors lead to shops where a cute shopkeeper provides free secondary magic weapons. Yes, you read it well, no money involved here, everything is free, but our hero can only use one magic weapon at the time. At the end of each area, our friend flies over the clouds and get to fight an obligatory end-of-stage boss.

		<name>Clay Pigeon (version 2.0) </name>
		<desc>The object of Clay Pigeon was to shoot as many clay targets as you can, using an arcade light gun that was shaped like a shotgun. At the start of the game you are given the choice of selecting either Trap Shooting or Skeet Shooting. Trap shooting is where the clay target is thrown directly away from the shooter, while in skeet shooting the target is launched across the shooter's field of vision. The graphics are done in Exidy's realistic style, each round is played against a decent looking outdoor background, and an extremely repetitive announcer yells 'pull' to warn you of each and every target being launched. After several rounds of targets, you finally get to go after some real live animals! The real live animals are of course, ducks! The ducks are small and fly onto the screen in small groups of up to around a half dozen or so, and unlike the earlier title "Vs. Duck Hunt", you cannot miss any of these. Missing any ducks in this round ends the game instantly, and will more than likely have you fumbling for another quarter in an attempt to do it right this time.

		<desc>Agent X, complete with trenchcoat, Bogie hat, and briefcase, hurries through a series of adventures and misadventures to retrieve stolen plans and destroy dastardly Dr. Boom's subterranean bomb factory. Our masked hero descends to the depths of Dr. Boom's laboratory in a special elevator. On each floor he encounters a series of conveyor belts that are moving explosives. A giant bomb ticks down the game seconds while devices of Dr. Boom's plotting, such as bomb converters, forklifts deflecting shots back at Agent X, robot guards, acid pits, and crawling eyes shooting death rays, challenge the player(s).

CLOAK &amp; DAGGER is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster video display. You control Agent X as he descends underground floor by floor in an elevator to Dr. Boom's lab, located on the 33rd floor. Your main goal is to retrieve Top Secret plans that are surrounded by an electrical arc. To stop the electrical current, Agent X must shoot all the fiery nodes as he fights off robot guards.

As Agent X leaves the elevator on each floor, he must make his way carefully and quickly across the screen to another exit. Each floor displays a configuration of conveyor belts moving green unarmed and red armed explosives.  Agent X can pick up the green explosives. The red explosives will explode on contact. Some floors have marauding robot guards, death-ray shooting crawling eyes, and acid pits.

Once Agent X has the top secret plans in hand, he must make his way back to the surface. If he exits on a floor that was bombed on the way down, he will find a massive crater protected by node monsters and the previously mentioned attackers. If he exits on a floor that was not bombed, a superguard will join the other attackers to challenge Agent X. On the final level, rumors are that he will meet the notorious Dr. Boom himself.

At the center of the display, a double-coiled fuse to a giant bomb is ticking down the game seconds for each level. Agent X can light the fuse in a rush for bonus points, but must be able to escape that level before the bomb explodes. If the fuse has shortened on its own to one coil, it lights automatically and prompts Agent X to make a mad dash to the waiting elevator. The doors close just as a burst of light from the explosion is seen. The game's perspective now changes to a full view inside the elevator. Messages flash across the elevator to give helpful hints on the next level.

Dr. Boom has placed explosive mines on every 4th floor. On each of the preceding 3 floors Agent X can pick up a secret map box that will show him part of the safe path across the minefield on the next 4th floor.

Agent X's first goal is to travel successfully from one elevator to the other; his second goal is to pick up a secret box to get a map of the minefield on levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32; the third goal is to light the bomb fuse and escape before the explosion.

As game play progresses, Agent X may find an extra-life box and a mystery box that give bonus points, double speed, half speed, and occasionally, an extra life. Extra bonus points are earned for picking up green unarmed explosives or for skipping floors.

If Agent X succeeds in capturing the top secret plans, he must fight his way back up to the top level. The appearance of box compressors, crawling eyes, and other enemies are more random on the way up than on the way down. If Agent X makes it back to the surface, a free game will be awarded (depending on the settings of the option switches).

The game ends when you use up your last life or successfully make it to the surface.

		<desc>This game was for two or four players only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players character will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponents before hitting something. Each player is eliminated when they crash, taking their lines with them. One good strategy is to turn around and head for the outer area of the screen (in four player mode), because everyone starts out headed for the center. Skirt around the edges until you only have one opponent left, then box them in. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own line, so avoid that at all cost.

		<desc>In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:
Machine Gun: Auto-fire.
Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.
Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.
Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game consists of ten stages:
Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)
Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)
Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)
Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)
Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)
Stage 06: Core of Base 2 (3D fixed)
Stage 07: Snow Field (horizontal scroll)
Stage 08: Energy Zone (horizontal scroll)
Stage 09: Hangar (horizontal scroll)
Stage 10: Alien Lair (horizontal scroll)

		<desc>Contra is a side scrolling action game by Konami and based on the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1987. In 2631, a mysterious meteoroid containing extraterrestrial life crashed through Earth's atmosphere and landed in New Zealand, near a group of islands. Two years later, a terrorist group organization known as the Red Falcon appears near the impact site and threatens to plunge humanity into destruction and chaos. The evil military group is believed to be helped by a malevolent alien race whose only purpose is to conquer the universe, and two elite commando marines (Bill Rizer and Lance Bean) are dispatched on a life-or-death mission to save the world. The fighters have the ability to jump, crouch, fire in eight directions and also move while using a weapon. They however have no shield energy nor life bar, and die in one hit. But the meat of the game lies elsewhere. Contra is popularly known for its serious fire-power on display, and although players start their mission equipped with a basic and ordinary rifle gun, more sophisticated and destructive weapons can be obtained throughout the game. Various large containers stamped with Red Falcon insignias on them release all kind of weapons with limitless ammo - Flamethrower (F), Laser Gun (L), Machine Gun (M) and 5-way Spread Gun (S). Special icons also give the players additional abilities, such as Rapid Fire (R) which increases the weapon's rate of fire, and the Barrier (B) which turns the player invincible for a short amount of time. Interestingly, although most of the game is played in a traditional 2D side-scrolling style of gameplay, the second and fourth levels switch to a 3D over-the-shoulder corridor perspective, and ask the players to fight their way through heavily defended rooms and corridors. Contra includes a two-player cooperative mode.

		<desc>Cosmo Gang the Video is the conversion of Namco's arcade game. The game is highly inspired by Galaga, ultra famous shooter released by the same company in 1981. This version, however, features cute colorful graphics and froggy like characters instead of the traditional alien flying saucers. Formations of flying pink frogs and other weird aliens fill-up the screen and the player's task is to clean the whole thing up. Power-ups have also been added to the mix : shields, a jack-in-the-box that freezes everything on the screen for a limited amount of time, mine fields and giant-webs to slow down all enemies on the screen. The game counts five worlds and each of them features five sub-stages - the player simply needs to clean up all the baddies in each of them to jump to the next stage. A Challenge Stage awaits at the end of each world - in there, the player has to prevent the froggy like characters from stealing precious items, from mysterious crates to bags of gold. The only real boss of the game, Boss Cosmo, awaits at the end of the game after completing the fifth world. A two simultaneous player mode is available.

		<name>Cotton (set 3, World, FD1094 317-0181a) </name>
		<desc>Marchen Adventure Cotton 100% is a side scrolling shooter by Success and Datam Polystar, and likely sequel to the arcade game Cotton originally released in 1989. The cute witch and her flying broom are back in this exclusive adventure for the Super Famicom system. Cotton, the sweet-addicted witch, sets off on a long journey to save the country. Well, when the fairies plead with her for help, she genuinely misunderstood her real mission. As a result of her uncontrollable obsession with sugary candies, she now believes that she is in search of the Willow Candy. Cotton is accompanied by Silk, a cute fairy who helps her along the way and guides her through seven colorful stages. The witch can defend herself with magic powers - she can shoot blasts of energy from her magic wand, as well as drop bombs on the ground below. Unlike traditional shooters, the leveling and power-up system is based on experience points - several crystals must be collected for one level of power-up, and this number increases as Cotton becomes more powerful. She also comes equipped with several kinds of offensive magic spells (Fire Dragon, Thunder, Barrior, Bubbles and so forth). Their types can be changed at the beginning of the game (in packs of three), and they can be switched out during the game by pressing the shoulder buttons. These attacks come in limited quantities and special icons released by certain enemies can replenish them. Finally, up to three fairies can be rescued and join the fight, and holding the bomb button for a few seconds can send them hurling towards the enemy. In the Cotton tradition, each stage ends with the tea time bonus section where the player tries to collect as many falling teacups as possible within a time limit.

You have 4 control buttons and you have the ability to move your balloon in any direction. Don't take too long, because if you are too slow, a bogey man erupts on the screen and forces you to move. Just when you think you have the maze all figured out, pin wheels attack your balloon forcing you to take evasive action.

		<desc>A one or two player sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which two cops, by the name of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody, fight gangs of criminals over six platform-strewn stages. Each stage centres around a specific criminal activity, such as bank robbery or smuggling. The ultimate goal in Crime City is to find the King-pin 'boss' characters that await the players at the end of each level, and arrest them.

The game's heroes start each level armed with a pistol, and extra weapons become available as players progress through a level. Both the pistol and additional weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition, and if players runs out of ammo, they will only be able to punch or "somersault attack" into attacking enemies. Each stage features numerous background items that can be used to attack enemies, such as wooden barrels, boxes and hanging lights. When shot, some criminals drop packets of illegal drugs, which can be picked up for bonus points.

Crime City's gameplay takes its inspiration from both Namco's "Rolling Thunder" and Sega's "Shinobi".

		<desc>Capcom Sports Club is a multi-event sports game for one or two players who can choose to play any one of three different sports games: Tennis (Smash Stars), Football (Kick Stars) and Basketball (Dunk Stars).

The game's look and feel is typical of Capcom's output of the time and is skewed heavily towards fast, cartoon-like arcade action.

Of the three games on offer, "Smash Stars" Tennis is by far the most accomplished and would easily stand up as an arcade machine in its own right.

		<desc>Cyber-Lip is a platform shoot-em-up for one or two players that borrows heavily from Konami's "Contra" series. Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world.

Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.

At the end of certain levels, the game's heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go 'up' or 'down', depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.

		<name>Daimakaimura (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Daimakaimura is a platform game by Capcom and is the SuperGrafx port of the classic arcade game known outside of Japan as Ghouls'n Ghosts. The brave Arthur, infamous for wearing red hearted boxers under his piece of armor, is back. His beloved princess Prin-Prin has been captured by the great demon king Loki and he has now, once again, the daunting task of rescuing her. His journey gets him through six long stages from a creepy cemetery infested with Grim Reapers and Vultures, to a abandoned windmills full of deadly stone turtles. Arthur starts the game equipped with a short joust spear that he can throw at his enemies. Treasure chests appear from time to time (usually triggered by jumping over specific spots of the scenery) and Arthur can crack them open to reveal new weapons, brand new piece of armors or, if already equipped with one, the almighty Golden Armor. But treasure chests can also reveal mean sorcerers who won't hesitate to turn our hero into an elderly man with a walking stick, or a cute but particularly vulnerable duck. Finally, the Golden Armor can be charged up and unleash powerful attacks from the equipped weapon. For instance, the spear can trigger a lighting spell and daggers a mirror-image of Arthur. The game is vast and mean guardians keep the gates leading to Loki's lair.

		<name>Daisenpu (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Dai Sen Puu is a vertical shooter, conversion of Toaplan/Taito's arcade game originally released back in 1989. The player controls a World War II fighter plane and must fly deep into enemy lines and destroy formations of tanks and other warships. Small trucks sometimes appear and release bonuses when shot: P (power ups), H (extra bomb) or flashing planes (extra life). A group of six planes can also be called to fly next to our fighter and shoot anything in sight. Pressing the bomb button twice drop a powerful bomb that cleans up a fair amount of the screen. Finally, Dai Sen Puu offers an unusual feature : levels do not pause between them and uncover instead a continuous flow of undisturbed shooting action.

		<name>Darius II (dual screen) (Japan, Rev 2) </name>
		<desc>The direct sequel to the 1986 original, Darius II retained the distinctive 3-screen format of the first game.

The power-up system of Darius II was changed from that of its parent game, with players having to destroy complete waves of a particular enemy to earn a power-up. 2 new power-ups were also added; the 1st was a new weapon power-up that gave the player green, vertical lasers, the 2nd power-up was a rainbow-colored item that powered up all of the players weapons.

Another new feature of Darius II is the appearance of mini-bosses - large enemies that appear at the mid point of a level, possessing similar strength and abilities to those of the game's normal bosses (such as extravagant weapons, or the inability to be damaged without first exposing a vulnerable area). The mini-bosses in Darius II are in fact smaller versions of the bosses from Darius.

The game is set in the inner regions of the Solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius, allowing players to select their own route through the game.

		<desc>In the game, the third in the sequel of Darius series; the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons: Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship. Some enemies leave panels behind that can be collected to power-up your shots, missiles or shield.

The graphics and sound are superior to those of the previous Darius games, and the game employs a lot of impressive visual effects; for example, the Silver Hawk warps into a stage dramatically in the fourth-tier stages, and begins to burn on re-entry at the start of the sixth-tier stages.

The bosses are huge and far more complex than those of the previous games, each employing several attack patterns and explode with powerful warping and twisting effects upon their defeat.

		<desc>A horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up that was unique at the time for featuring a game screen that was three times wider than the conventional size, with the arcade cabinet utilizing three CRT screens to accommodate it.

In the game, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons : Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship.

During the course of the levels the player must navigate the terrain and battle a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles. At the end of every level, players are greeted with the obligatory end-of-level boss. The bosses in Darius are often in the form of mechanical aquatic animals, such as fish or squid. If the player defeats the boss, the tunnel splits into two and the player must decide whether to take the upper or lower tunnel, both of which lead to a different stage. This allows many different paths to be taken through the game.

Power-ups can be obtained by shooting enemies of a certain color, with the power-ups appearing in the form of colored bubbles. Each color corresponds to one of the ship's three weapons :
* Red - Missile
* Green - Bomb
* Blue - Arm

If the player powers up a weapon more than seven times, the weapon changes to a new, more powerful version. This then becomes the player's default weapon, and can be powered up further. There are also two other colors of power-up bubble, white and orange; which can be obtained by shooting at certain sections of the terrain; unfortunately, there are no visual clues as to where these may be on any given level. These hidden power-ups offer the following :
* White - Gives a score bonus.
* Orange - Smart bomb that kills all on-screen enemies.

		<name>Double Dragon (World set 1) </name>
		<desc>Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.

Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.

The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: 
* Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.
* Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.
* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).
* Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.
* Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.
* Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. 
* Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.

		<name>Defender (bootleg) </name>
		<desc>Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.

A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.

If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.

The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.

Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.

If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.

		<desc>Depthcharge is a 2-Dimensional shooter. You control your destroyer on the surface of the water while submarines patrol underneath. Your job is to drop depth charges to eliminate these submarines. The submarines aren't defenseless as they launch mines straight up toward your ship.

Depthcharge was one of the early video games. Action was simple. This game also had the ability to retain the highest score (without the initials of course). Although the game is simple in concept, just trying to get enough points was enough to keep you working at it. Good luck on your submarine hunting mission.

		<name>Dharma Doujou </name>
		<desc>Dharma Doujou is a puzzle game by Metro and Den'Z, and conversion of an arcade game of the same name. The game stars a little monk and a cute shrine maiden who have both been specially trained by their master to battle Y?kai monsters. As a matter of fact, all kind of Oni demons and other strange apparitions have caused major mayhem and mischief throughout the valley, and the two monks decide to put a decisive stop to all of this. In story mode, the player goes through a series of single-screen puzzles (eight levels each containing three rounds), all made out of stacked up blocks. The goal of the game is a heart pounding race against the clock - in each round, a demon, located on the left of the screen, climbs up a rope and must be stopped before he reaches the ceiling and releases a large temple bell onto the player's blocks. And there is only one way to slow the dreaded foe down - the player must use his or her large mallet to hit blocks and make them fall into a separate compartment located at the bottom of the screen (this aspect of the game certainly reminds of Dharma Otoshi, a traditional Japanese children's game). If three identical blocks (or up to eight later in the game) are aligned correctly inside the compartment, they turn into a good spirit and perform a short strike attack against the demon, thus slowing him down. If not, the blocks are sent back to the main stack, and the player must quickly think of a better way to align or shift more blocks. Interestingly, the gameplay slightly changes depending on which character the player chooses - as the monk, each puzzle must be completed within a time limit, but as the maiden, they have to be completed in a set amount of moves. Dharma Doujou features a couple more play modes such as an unlimited mode (where rows of blocks just keep appearing) and a puzzle mode (where the player must align blocks so they match a pattern within a certain move count or time limit). However, although most of the modes are oriented for single-played sessions, a two-player battle mode is also available and allows two friends to fight head to head. Finally, while levels are apparently randomly generated in the story mode, a clever password system lets player save their progress.

		<name>Dangan Feveron (Japan, Ver. 98/09/17) </name>
		<desc>A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up from the undisputed masters of the genre, 'Cave', Dangun Feveron features the usual Cave trademarks of intuitive, power-up driven gameplay backed-up with superb graphics and sound.

Dangun Feveron features a very high level of player customisation. At the start of a new game, players are prompted to select 3 different ship attributes; the speed of ship they wish to pilot (from a choice of four), which of the 3 rapid-fire weapons they prefer, and their preferred choice of sustained-fire weapons (activated by holding down the FIRE button). This allows players to tailor the ship to suit their individual needs and gameplay styles, be it a fast-flying speeder with widespread shots to handle enemy squadrons, or a ship with a lower speed that makes it easier to negotiate the swathes of enemy bullets that often fill the screen.

Another of the game's selling points is the capture-and-score system. Initially, every enemy destroyed is worth only one point. However, whenever an enemy is destroyed, coloured spheres appear in its wake, each containing a trapped, human prisoner. The spheres can then be collected by the player to earn additional points. For each prisoner saved, the total points gained from each enemy killed increases by one. For example, saving 56 prisoners means every subsequent defeated enemy is worth fifty-seven points. When the spheres appear, they drift slowly towards the bottom of the screen, before moving back up towards the top where, if they are not collected in time, they drift out of the screen and beyond the player's reach. This resets enemy-destroyed score back to a single point per enemy. If the player loses all of their lives and chooses to 'Continue' the game, the rescue count is reset to zero.

Dangun Feveron's final distinction was in its use of music and sound effects, with the game's creators drawing heavily on the disco sound of the 1970s.

		<name>Diamond Run </name>
		<desc>An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is littered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player's path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player.

In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave.

Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star's Commodore C64 classic, 'Boulder Dash'.

		<desc>For this sequel to the 1982 classic, "Dig Dug", Namco changed the game's perspective from a sideways viewpoint, to an overhead one. Action now takes place on a series of small islands. 

The gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with players still armed with a pump that allows them to inflate and burst the enemies. For this sequel, however, Namco also introduced ground-based charges. Players can activate the charges in order to join them up with other charges, represented on screen by the appearance of trenches. Once a line of charges is linked to two of the island's edges, the charges will detonate and destroy a piece of the island, killing any enemies that happen to be standing on the piece when it's destroyed. Players must be careful not to be standing on a piece that is destroyed, or they themselves will be killed.

		<name>Donkey Kong 3 (Japan) </name>
		<desc>The third and final arcade outing for Donkey Kong sees the giant ape once again cast as the enemy. Unlike the first two Donkey Kong games, the legendary character Mario is not featured in this game. Instead, the player takes on the role of Stanley the Bugman, a gardener who is armed with a bug spray with which he must destroy the swarms of insects that attack him and try to steal his plants. 

Each level has five plants that must be protected. Stanley must also spray Kong to force the ape to the top of the screen and complete the level. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Stanley - Stanley's job is to defend the greenhouse that Donkey Kong has invaded. He does this with his trusty bug spray. When Stanley pumps his spray can, the spray travels a certain distance before dissipating so it's not useful against targets that are far away. Stanley primarily uses his bug spray to zap bugs or to make Donkey Kong scoot up the vines that he holds onto. In order to complete each stage, Stanley's goal is to either push Donkey Kong all the way up the vine using bug spray, or defeat every insect present in that stage. There are many ways for Stanley to lose a life, including touching an insect, getting shot by any of the bee stingers, running out of time, or allowing Donkey Kong to slip off the bottom of the vine. 

Donkey Kong - Nintendo's favorite simian seems to have been working out a little bit compared to his previous appearances. Donkey Kong attempts to keep himself above harm's way by hanging onto two vines that descend from the greenhouse ceiling. If left alone, Donkey Kong slips down the vines little by little, hoping to land on Stanley by surprise. Occasionally, he will reach over to one of the two beehives along side him and tap them in order to send more bees after Stanley. In the yellow stages, he even grabs coconuts from time to time and lobs them at Stanley's head. Starting in round 15, he will throw coconuts at you regardless of the stage. 

Super Spray - One time for every one of Stanley's lives, a more powerful bug spray will be perched on Donkey Kong's right vine. When Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough so that his hand is touching the spray, the spray falls to the ground, at which time Stanley can pick it up. The Super Spray lasts for a number of seconds, and continues with Stanley to the next stage until the full time runs out. When this spray is activated, Donkey Kong is forced up the vines much faster, Creepies die when hit, and Queen Bees die in one hit. It will not be replenished after it runs out until Stanley loses a life, so it's not a good idea to plan your strategy around it's use. 

Beespy &amp; Buzzbee - These bugs are the primary attack force of the hive. Stanley starts the game squaring off against the Beespies as they swoop down and try to steal Stanley's vegetables. Starting in round 12, the hive switches to their faster and more aggressive soldiers, the Buzzbees. Buzzbees strike at Stanley more directly than Beespies. Either bee may or may not be accompanying a Queen Bee, but they are dangerous either way. 

Queen Bees - Starting in round 3, the Queen Bees of the hive will from time to time enter the fray surrounded by their royal escorts. One shot isn't enough to do them in, it simply changes them from red to blue. Even after you shoot them a second time, the threat isn't over. When killed, they split up in to 4 tiny projectiles that can kill you if they connect. You are only safe directly beneath them when they die. 

Buttifly &amp; Beetle - Starting in round 6, the Buttiflies escape from the hive. They fly down along the side of the screen until they are even with Stanley, pause for a brief moment, and then charge across the screen in an attempt to collide with him. They disappear after round 16, only to be replaced with Beetles in round 18, who are bigger and a bit harder to dodge. Beetles do not pause as Buttiflies do, and attack immediately. 

Moth - The Moth is the mercenary of the bee hive, employed from round 24 and on. They move erratically, so it's slightly difficult to predict where they are going to end up. They will occasionally attack Stanley, or they will swoop down for his vegetables. Don't let them distract you from your efforts to force Donkey Kong up the vine, but don't get in their way either, or let them fly away with your plants. 

Creepy - This worm likes to play interference. In the blue and gray stages, he crawls down to the platforms from the plants along the side of the screen. Once he reaches the platform, he will wiggle back and forth and make a nuisance of himself. He cannot be killed by the normal bug spray, but he is quite allergic to it, and spraying him causes him to stop in his tracks until he finishes coughing. He can be persuaded to climb back up the plant for a while if you blast him with spray before he reaches the platforms. In yellow stages, three or more Creepies will slide along the vines below Donkey Kong and try to get in the way of your bug spray. If you hit one, not only with it absorb the spray, but you'll have to wait for it to finish coughing before he will move on and allow you to shoot Kong. They can be killed by super spray. 

Beebomb - After an insect successfully steals one of your plants, it turns into a Beebomb. Beebombs circle around a few times near the hive that they came from, and then immediately dive bomb towards Stanley. They are incredibly fast when diving towards you, but due to their direct attack nature, they are easy to defeat as long as you keep your eyes on them and time a blast of bug spray just as they are about to hit you. 

Vine Eater - These creatures appear when the bonus timer runs out. When the timer reaches zero, two of these appear on either side of the screen. They are oblivious to bug spray. When they reach the vines, they eat the vine from the bottom up to the ceiling. If they eat the section of vine that Donkey Kong is holding on to, Donkey Kong falls down and Stanley loses a life just as if he had allowed Donkey Kong to drop off the vine himself.

Donkey Kong introduced a number of wholly original game-play ideas to the platform genre. It was the first ever game to feature multiple play-fields, for example. It was also the first game that allowed players to jump over objects. Its creation came about due to the commercial failure of another game called "Radar Scope". A consequence of which was an excess of redundant arcade cabinets. In an attempt to limit their losses, Nintendo commissioned Donkey Kong and history was made.

Originally both the US and Japanese versions asked us 'How High Can You Try?'. This was quickly grammatically corrected to ask the familiar 'How High Can You Get?'. 

The game does end, as it has a 'kill screen'! The timer in L-22 expires so quickly that the 25m stage cannot be completed.

		<name>Donkey Kong Jr. (bootleg) </name>
		<desc>Something of a role reversal for this superb sequel to the seminal 1981 platform-based original, with Mario now cast as the villain (the only Mario game in which this occurred) and Donkey Kong cast as the captured victim. 

Donkey Kong's son, DK Jr., must rescue his captured father from Mario's clutches by climbing and jumping his way over vines, chains and platforms before he can reach his father. Jr. has to race against time while avoiding the horrible Snapjaws, Nitpickers, and Sparks released by Mario. 

Like the original, Donkey Kong Jr. features four different stages, but in the US version, one or both of the middle stages are omitted in the first three levels. In the Japanese and bootleg versions, all four stages are played in their logical order. Please refer to the "Donkey Kong Junior" (North American version) entry, Updates section, for complete details. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS -

Donkey Kong Jr. - The baby ape in the white unitard with a big J printed on the front, this is the son of Donkey Kong and he must rescue his father from Mario's cage. 

Mario - This game is quite possibly the ONLY game in Mario's long history where he is the enemy. 

Donkey Kong - Poor DK was captured by Mario after the events portrayed in Donkey Kong. Now he must helplessly watch as his son comes to the rescue. 

Snapjaws - These mechanical mouths must be avoided. Blue Snapjaws will drop down a vine and continue to fall off the screen, while Red Snapjaws will climb back up a vine and pose a more permanent threat. 

Nitpickers - There are two types of Nitpickers in the game. Small Nitpickers appear on the Springboard Stage and occasionally drop eggs on Jr. as they fly around the top branch. Large Nitpickers appear on the Chains stage and weave back and forth in an attempt to hinder Jr.'s chances at rescuing his father. 

Sparks - These volts of electricity patrol the Mario's Hideout Stage. The red variety follows the loop that they begin on while the blue version follows the vertical strips from one level to the next as they drop to the bottom of the screen. 

Fruit - Jr. will find various pieces of fruit scattered throughout each stage that he will pluck when he touches them. The fruit will fall and take out any enemy in its path until it reaches the bottom of the screen. They are one of the best sources for bonus points. 

Keys - On the first three stages, Jr.'s goal is to reach the key at the top of the stage. Once he jumps onto the vine or chain with the key at the top, he automatically climbs it to the adjacent platform and advances to the next stage. On the Chains Stage, Jr. must push six keys up the chains into the locks positioned at the top of the stage. When all six keys are inserted into the locks, Papa will be set free.

		<name>Mr. Do's Castle (set 1) </name>
		<desc>For the second game in the Mr. Do! series, the clown finds himself in a traditional platforms and ladders game. Each level is made up of six floors (seven including the castle's ramparts) and all are joined by a number of inter-connecting ladders. The ladders come in two different varieties: vertical ladders, which are fixed and cannot be moved; and diagonal ladders, which can be pushed left or right from the top of the ladder. This allows Mr. Do to reach other areas of the level and is sometimes necessary to redirect the path of any pursuing enemies. 

The enemies in Mr. Do's Castle come in the form of unicorns, and as with the enemies of the first game, they will hunt down and try to kill Mr. Do. Replacing the 'Powerball' weapon of the original game, Mr. Do is now armed with a mallet. This can be used to temporarily stun the unicorns and buy Mr. Do some time to escape; but its primary function is to knock out the floor blocks that form each level's platforms.

Most blocks are marked with a cherry and collecting all of these will complete the level (on later revisions only, see Updates below). A level can also be completed by killing all of the unicorns. This is achieved by using the mallet to remove blocks and knock holes in the platforms. The unicorns will fall into any holes that the player has created; some simply fall through to the platform below, whereas others are trapped. Trapped unicorns can be hit with Mr. Do's mallet and knocked to a lower platform - useful for buying a few extra seconds for the player. If left alone, however, the unicorns will climb out, filling the hole in behind them, and transform into much nastier enemies. These new enemies cannot be stunned with the mallet and must be killed by dropping blocks onto them from the platform above.

Some sections of a platform have two 'skull' blocks at either end of them, with normal blocks in between. When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all of the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards. This is highly effective in killing several enemies at once.

Each level also has three 'key' blocks. If Mr. Do knocks out all three key blocks, a large door opens at the top of the screen to reveal a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into 'Alphamonsters'. The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor block onto them from above. When Mr. Do kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded.

		<name>Domino Man </name>
		<desc>The player controls Domino Man, a bespectacled, moustachioed artist who must set up a chain of giant dominoes across the screen, to form a chain of dominoes which can then be toppled.

The dominoes must be placed on sites marked by black spots, achieved by simply running over each spot. Once all of the spots are covered with a domino, the chain is complete. The player will then have the choice of either knocking them all down to clear the level, or simply wait for a few seconds to continue to the next screen, in hope of completing the chain on THAT level, and so on. In this way, the player can set up several chains and knock them all down in one fell swoop, earning many bonus points in the process. Multiple chains are, of course, very difficult to achieve.

Domino Man's progress is hampered by a neighborhood bully who walks onto the screen and tries to knock over the first dominoes he comes across. The player must either try to complete and topple the chain of dominoes before the bully knocks them over, or hit the bully with a domino; causing the bully's trousers to fall down and disabling him for a few seconds. A killer bee also appears, and if it manages to sting the player, a life is lost. A bag lady and a boy pushing a shopping cart wander blindly around the levels, occasionally knocking over some of the dominoes. Domino Man can hit them, however, causing them to change direction.

Once a game is over, a poem is displayed on-screen to evaluate the player's performance on the game. For example :
Roses are red
Or so goes the verse,
You set up fifty-two
You could have done worse.

		<name>Mr. Do's Wild Ride </name>
		<desc>Mr Do's third arcade outing is another platform game, following on from the superb "Mr. Do's Castle", released a year earlier. The synonymous Mr. Do! cherries are present and correct, but are not used in the same way as in other games in the series. In both "Mr Do!" and "Mr. Do's Castle", collecting all of the cherries available was a way of completing a level. In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the 'prize' awarded upon reaching the level's goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.

The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong", with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn't have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.

Each of the game's six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn't feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.

The levels are :
Level 1, Roller Coaster. 
Level 2, Pirate Ship. 
Level 3, Three Elevators. 
Level 4, Castle on Screen. 
Level 5, Multiple Columns. 
Level 6, Six Rings.

After level six the levels are repeated.

		<desc>Dragonninja is a sideways scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players in which the US president, President Ronnie (based on ex-U.S. president, Ronald Reagan), has been abducted by the nefarious DragonNinja clan.

Players take on the role of two government agents - 'Blade' and 'Striker' - who must fight their way through 7 enemy-packed levels to defeat the DragonNinja and save the President.

Each stage must be completed with a set time limit and initially the agents can only punch, kick and jump, although they can execute powerful spinning kicks and have the ability to charge themselves up with "inner energy" - by holding the punch button - to throw a powerful, long-range flaming punch that hits all opponents in front of the player.

Players will also come across weapon power-ups in the form of knives and Nunchuks. Player health can be replenished by picking up the drinks cans (resembling Coco-Cola cans) that also occasionally appear. Clocks can also be picked up to extend the stage's time limit.

At the end of each stage, players must defeat powerful end-of-level bosses, the first of which is Karnov, who was the star of his own 1987 video game of the same name.

For the game's 7th and final stage, players must re-fight all of the bosses from the previous stages, before finally confronting the Dragon Ninja himself. Defeating the Dragon Ninja frees the U.S. president and the game is over.

		<name>Dr. Micro </name>
		<desc>An early platform game in which the player must defeat a mad scientist, avoiding and destroying his evil creations in the process.

The game consists of 3 single-screen levels :

On the first the player must move from the left to the right of the screen, dropping down onto constantly moving metal pillars and shooting the enemies.

On the second level, the player must steer a floating ball around the screen, killing as many enemies as possible. Once enough enemies have been killed, an exit will open which the player must enter. The floating ball gradually diminishes and the player will have to drop to the bottom of the screen several times to get a replacement ball.

The final screen takes place on the scientist's production line; with machinery that must be carefully negotiated. Two large robots bar the route to the scientist and must be destroyed before the scientist can be reached.

		<name>Dragon Saber </name>
		<desc>Dragon Saber is a vertical shooter by Namco and conversion of the arcade game of the same name originally released in 1990, itself sequel of "Dragon Spirit". The game takes place far into the future, at a time when humanity's growing egoism and lack of respect for life and nature causes chaos on the Earth, slowly leading to its inevitable destruction. Monsters and evil creatures now roam the planet and in a desperate plea for help, the Sun goddess Aria asks two courageous knights, Huey and Siria, to go on the most perilous mission ever undertaken by mortals. Armed with a magical saber and the power to transform into fire breathing dragons, the warriors embark on a heroic journey to save the world. Dragon Saber follows the precedent established by its predecessor - players are able to hit enemies in the air as well as on the ground, and colored eggs scattered around each level gives them the opportunity to increase their dragon's firepower (blue egg) or base damage (red egg). However, the game offers some new features over its prequel - each player can now charge up powerful blasts of energy (by releasing the fire button for a few seconds) and different kinds of dragon power-ups have made their appearances, such as lightning bolts or Energy Wings, each one with their own super attack! Dragon Saber consists of eight levels and features a two-player simultaneous option.

The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.

		<name>The Cliffhanger - Edward Randy (Japan ver 3) </name>
		<desc>A fast moving platform game in which the player controls the Indiana Jones-esque and unfortunately named 'Edward Randy'. The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.

		<desc>Enduro Racer is an off-road racing game in which players ride a dirt bike across five extremely hilly and twisting courses. Each course is littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over or avoided.

Jumps can only be performed at specific locations on each track. These locations feature a dirt ramp that spreads across the width of the track. Players must have the bike in the 'wheelie' position when the ramp is struck, the bike will then be launched into the air. If the bike is not in a wheelie position when the ramps are struck, the bike will still clear the ramp, but will land front-wheel first and crash.

Enduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.

		<name>Escape Kids (Asia, 4 Players) </name>
		<desc>An unusual take on the overhead racing genre, Escape Kids has up to 4 players taking on the role of an athletic runner and competing to be the first to cross the finish line in a number of 3-lap races. As well as running, each player has a limited number of 'Super Jumps'; these allow the player to leap over both rival runners and obstacles.

Money is awarded for finishing first, and players can upgrade their runner depending on the amount of money they have available. Runners can be given extra super jumps, an upgrade to stop the runner from skidding when going through a bend in the track, quicker recovery time from falls, or be made stronger (and thus less likely to be knocked over by a rival runner). Special items occasionally appear and can be picked up and used. These range from an item that causes a small earthquake (causing all of the rival runners to tumble along the ground, thus slowing them down) and a bomb, which renders any runner that runs into it unable to move for several seconds.

Each race has a total of five competitors (either human or computer controlled) and players must finish in first place or are disqualified. Any player who wins all three races in a round will be taken to a bonus screen. Here, the player's on-screen counterpart rides a bike and the player must collect as much money as possible.

		<name>E-Swat - Cyber Police (bootleg) </name>
		<desc>The player takes on the role of a rookie cop in this sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up from Sega. A powerful crime syndicate is creating chaos in the cop's home city and he must prove his ability as a police officer by capturing a number of crime bosses, killing as many of their henchmen as possible in the process. The policeman carries a standard issue pistol which only has a limited amount of ammunition. In the event of the ammunition running out, players will only be able to kick their enemies. Extra Ammo can be picked up at various points in the levels.

As the player progresses through the game and makes more and more arrests, their on-screen character will be promoted through the ranks. First to Captain, then Assistant Chief, Chief and finally, once three crime bosses have been arrested, to a full E-SWAT agent. Adorning full, robot-style body armour that bears more than a passing resemblance to the "Robocop" character from the games and movies of the same name. In armoured mode, the cop has vastly increased firepower, including a limited number of bombs that are ejected by a mechanical device on the policeman's back.

As the armoured cop is shot, his armour will gradually disappear until he is finally killed.

E-Swat plays very much like a cross between Sega's own 1987 classic "Shinobi", as well as Namco's superb "Rolling Thunder".

		<name>Exerion </name>
		<desc>Exerion is a top-down vertical shooter by Jaleco and conversion of an arcade game originally released in 1982. In the year 2991, the Zorni forces launched a surprise attack on planet Exerion and the Fighter EX is sent to counter the threat. Hordes of attacking ships appear from the top of the screen, periodically shooting or diving down towards the player's ship. The space fighter comes equipped with two weapons - a standard twin-shot and a rapid fire. Although the slow twin-shot comes in unlimited supply, the powerful rapid fire is limited to a certain amount of ammo (the remaining rapid shots are called 'charges' and are displayed at the bottom of the screen). As the player kills enemies, the amount of rapid fire shots slowly increases, and the core of the gameplay is to find the perfect balance between the slow but wide twin-shot, and the fast but limited rapid fire. Although the game borrows many elements from popular top-down shooters available the time (such as Galaxian or Phoenix), it separates itself from its peers for a number of reasons. First of all, the background features a pseudo perspective and a 3D/Parallax scrolling that smoothly transitions from one area to the next. Then the ship has considerable inertia, allowing the player to execute complex evasive maneuvers with some practice, or to plunge to his doom. Although Exerion indefinitively loops, it includes four types of levels (mountains, Clouds, City and Pyramids), each consisting of several enemy waves. Every fifth stage is a bonus area where the player takes down as many alien ships as possible in order to no only boost his score, but also to increase his rapid shot charge.

		<name>Exed Exes </name>
		<desc>Exed Exes is a vertical shooter by Tokuma Shoten and conversion of an arcade game originally released by Capcom in 1985. The game takes place in the midst of a raging war - insect like creatures called the Exes have invaded Neg-Nin, a far distant planet in a remote galaxy, thousands of light years away from Earth. Scientists on Neg-Nin started to build a warship in reaction to the sudden bug invasion. The fighter comes equipped with a particle cannon which can be upgraded to double or triple laser beams by collecting special Pow icons dotted around each level. Unlike most other shooters of its kind, upgrades in Exed Exes are not cumulative, and specific Pow icons power-up the craft to the lowest, middle or highest power level (some, called woP even downgrade the main weapon). The ship comes with a limited amount of Mega Crush bombs that clear all enemy bullets from the screen. Levels follow a traditional structure, with waves of all kind of multicolored insects (bees, beetles, flies, dragonflies), large bugs and ground cannons that relentlessly bombard the player. Also, through several levels, the player automatically enters bonus phases called Hi-Point Areas. The background turns black and different types of enemies (usually skulls) slowly move down the screen. They can easily be destroyed, but collecting special Pow icons instantly turns them into fruits for extra points. Each level ends with a boss battle, and each one of them is made out of different components (skulls, guns and flashing cores) that need to be destroyed in order to proceed to the next stage. Exed Exes features a two-player simultaneous option.

		<name>Express Raider (US set 1) </name>
		<desc>The wild west-themed Express Raider is separated into two different game types; a sideways scrolling fighting sequence and a shooting sequence. The player controls a train robber, or 'Express Raider', and must try to steal the bags of money from the moving locomotives.

During the fighting sequence, the Raider must fight the bank teller, hit the coyotes and then jump onto the train before it speeds away. Once on the train, he must fight his way past other enemies and avoid various projectiles, such as bottles, bullets and shovels full of coal. Players must be careful to duck under the low signs that come along as the train is travelling. Also, once a train carriage is clear of enemies, a bomb will appear between the current carriage and the next; players must quickly jump over to the next carriage before the bomb goes off, otherwise the Raider will fall from the train and a life is lost. If the Express Raider manages to reach the train engine, the loot will be captured and the game will then move on to the shooting sequence.

In the shooting sequence, the Express Raider rides a horse and must shoot at the enemies that appear from the windows of a train carriage. They will shoot back at the player and throw various objects. Players can hit the DUCK button to avoid the enemy attacks. A woman will appear at regular intervals offering the player a bag of money, if the player shoots the woman, a life is lost. After the shooting sequence has been completed, the game will start over again with an increased level of difficulty.

Exterminator is set in a street of houses and players must move from room to room in each property, clearing each one of the infestation, before moving onto the next house. Each player can initially only grab or 'thump' enemies (the latter for ground-based, crawling insects), but a number of power-ups, such as bug spray and somewhat bizarrely, a laser firing finger can be collected to make progress a little easier.

Like "Qix" and its sequels, Fantasia's levels are populated with a number of enemies who must be avoided or destroyed. As well as the enemies, players are also fighting against a tight time limit.

This game has incredible visual impact for this time, Freddie flies the skies over the Alps--over trains, trees, bridges, through winter and summer seasons; over the Pacific--over a yacht, tropical islands, an aircraft carrier; and over Egypt--camels, Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Sphinx, through day and night landscapes. It's a complete global challenge with non-stop action over a continuously changing panorama below.

This game used an advanced (proprietary), compression algorithm to hold nearly 3700 questions in a tiny amount of EPROM space (roughly 128K, which was still a huge amount of storage in 1983, which was why this game was so expensive). Exidy also sold several EPROM replacement kits that provided new questions, but they sold very poorly, and are nearly impossible to find today.

		<desc>Final Fight is a side scrolling beat'm up and is the conversion by Capcom of their own arcade game originally released in 1989. The game features two playable characters - the heavy built but slow former champion wrestler Mike Haggar and the more agile and fast martial art expert Joe Cody. Here is the first difference that would strike players used to the arcade game - the third character from the original game, Guy, is nowhere to be seen. The Mad Gears gang has taken over Metro city and has kidnapped the daughter of the newly elected mayor, Mike Haggar. Jessica also happens to be Cody's girlfriend and our two heroes must fight their way through the city, beat-up dozens and dozens of vile gang members and finally take down the evil Belger, their murderous leader. Levels are built around locked-in sections, in which all opponents must be defeated to continue. The game also includes several bonus stages such as a fun car-breaking exercise with an iron pipe. Each fighter can use simple fighting moves such as punches, jumps and pressing punch rapidly triggers powerful combos. They can also grab and throw, or hold on and hit their enemies. Finally, each fighter comes with a special attack when punch and jump are pressed simultaneously - this move drains some of their health energy but allows them to safely escape desperate situations. This Super Famicom port is a cut-down version of the original arcade game, the two players mode is gone as well as the fourth factory/Industrial stage.

		<desc>Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil 'Mad Gear' gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.

1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.

After the benchmark-setting "Double Dragon", released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.

		<desc>The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

		<desc>A precursor to 1986's "Bubble Bobble", the player controls a spell-casting elf who turns evil wizards, witches and other enemies into cakes and either pushes them from the platform ledges, or shoots then repeatedly to destroy them. If an enemy touches the player character, the elf becomes entrapped in a magic bubble and floats away. Each level takes place inside a variety of castles.

		<desc>Take off on a fantastic video trip. A voyage that simulates the thrills and skills of actual Hang Gliding. Players use the joystick to control Freddie, but good timing and strategy is necessary to successfully negotiate invisible air currents, wind direction and up and down drafts. This game has incredible visual impact for this time, Freddie flies the skies over the Alps--over trains, trees, bridges, through winter and summer seasons; over the Pacific--over a yacht, tropical islands, an aircraft carrier; and over Egypt--camels, Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Sphinx, through day and night landscapes. It's a complete global challenge with non-stop action over a continuously changing panorama below.

		<name>Flyball (rev 2) </name>
		<desc>This game is a very basic implementation of the game of baseball. The graphics are in black and white monochrome, and each side only has a single player (well the pitching team only has the pitcher, but several men can get on base at once). The game uses analog controls to simulate both pitching and hitting, so a smooth motion of the joystick will produce the best results. The pitcher is the only person on the field besides the base runners, so it is often best to make for one base further than the one you would have thrown the ball to (the pitcher has to run after the batter). The game only lasts for 1 or 2 innings (depending on how it is set), so each at bat really counts.

		<name>Taisen Idol-Mahjong Final Romance 2 (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Taisen Idol-Mahjong Final Romance 2 is strip mahjong game featuring nine different girls with three strip sequences each.

Before facing each opponent, the player may buy cheat items to help him in the following rounds against that girl. Funds for the store come from the players winnings in the previous rounds and roll over across continues.

A strip sequence is shown every time the player wins a hand. Strip sequences consist of scrolling, still images of the girl with limited animation of facial expressions. If a player depletes an opponents betting funds, then the game will advance through all of the strip sequences for that opponent.

Occasionally, after defeating an opponent, the player is given the opportunity to play a mini-game of high-low. The player is shown a tile and must guess if the next tile will be higher or lower than the tile shown.  If the player wins all three rounds, he is given a cheat item.

The player looses the game once all of his betting funds are depleted. Upon continuing the player keeps any unused cheat items and may buy more items from the store, but all of the player's wins against the current opponent are wiped out.

		<name>Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder (World) </name>
		<desc>Like it's legendary prequel, 1989's "Golden Axe"; 'Revenge' is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil 'Death Adder' has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game's characters. The four available characters are 'Sternblade' (a barbarian warrior), 'Dora' (a female centaurian), 'Goah' (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and 'Little Trix' (an agile, oriental-style warrior).

As with 'Golden Axe', as well as standard weapon attacks, each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures and contraptions (such as dragons, giant scorpions and catapults) which, once the original occupier has been removed from the saddle, can be mounted and ridden/utilized to attack the enemy.

At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, dwarfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the dwarfs causing them to drop food and magic potions. During the course of the game, players will also come across numerous trapped prisoners. These can be released by either opening their cages (by pulling a rope or similar) or hacking at their foot manacles.

Unlike the linear level layout of its prequel, 'Revenge' offers the player a branching route through the game, adding to its variety and longevity.

		<desc>A 1 or 2-player scrolling beat-em-up, with players selecting a character from a choice of 5; in which 2 'Elemental Warriors' must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Each player-character possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the 2.

Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom's 1989 classic, "Final Fight", and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega's legendary "Golden Axe", also from 1989. The latter is particularly evident in the use of the Magical Attack, which acts as a smart bomb and is also identical to the magic attacks featured in 'Golden Axe'.

Gaia Crusader's superb combo-geared control layout allows players to produce some highly impressive moves and attacks.

		<name>Galaga (Namco rev. B) </name>
		<desc>Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called "Galagans". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. 

Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. 

The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it is destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. 

As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. 

Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values, as dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting. Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). 

The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in one row of four), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in two rows of eight, directly below the Boss Galaga), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in two rows of ten, directly below the Butterflies). 

In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in most of the later stages. 

From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green 'Spy Ships' from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. 

Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of eight Galagans is destroyed, bonus points are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10,000 points. 

Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are : 
1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. 
2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each.

		<desc>The magical fan-waving cat guides you through mahjong with 10 lovely ladies with 3 strip sequences each.

Before each hand, the player may use points earned during gameplay (and awarded with each continue) to buy cheat items for use in the following hands.

A strip sequence is shown every time the player wins a hand, but if a girls betting funds are completely depleted, then the game will skip strait to her final strip sequence.

Each girl's first two strip sequence consist of a still image of the girl in progressive states of undress. The third strip sequence involves a risqué scene featuring some fairly crude animation that is advanced by repeatedly pressing the ron button.

After defeating a girl, the next opponent is selected randomly by dice-roll.

If a player's betting funds are depleted, then it is game over.

		<name>Galaga '88 </name>
		<desc>Galaga '88 is a vertical shooter and conversion of Namco's arcade game of the same name originally released in 1987. Shoot the descending aliens! The game closely follows the gameplay mechanics introduced by Galaga and Galaxian, although it adds its own twists to the classic formula. It introduces a myriad of new and wacky enemies - some comically inflate as they get hit, some combine into larger foes whereas others explode and release swarms of all kind of tiny creatures. Every few levels, the player enters a bonus stage where formations of dancing aliens must be destroyed for points, and some levels even switch to vertical scrolling phases interspersed with a few boss battles. Although the game only features seven large areas (all divided into 25 sub-stages), the player can travel through different dimensions and technically access new and unique levels (two blue warp-pods must be collected in each area in order to jump to a higher dimension, giving the game a total of 22 areas). Finally, as in the original Galaga, some enemies can capture the player's ship with their tractor beams, and successfully freeing the captured ship doubles the player's firepower - the operation can be performed twice for the ultimate and powerful triple-ship! Interestingly, Galaga'88 allows the player to directly start the game with a double-ship (at the cost of one life).

		<name>Cosmo Police Galivan (12/16/1985) </name>
		<desc>Galivan is a single player platform shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the roll of a 'Cosmo Police' officer who runs and jumps around a multi-directional scrolling cave system, destroying or avoiding waves of constantly attacking robots, aliens and alien ships.

The player starts the game as an unarmed human, whose only attacking options are kicking and punching, but picking up a POW item encases the human in a robotic suit and arms the player with a laser gun.

Collecting the blue POW items while in the suit awards the player with a powerful beam weapon for a limited time, while the red POW item gives the player a three-shot cannon. POW items are dotted throughout the levels and can also be gained by shooting the blue robot aliens.

The player's character has an energy bar that decreases whenever the player is hit. Should this fall below the halfway point, the robot suit will be lost and the player will once again be an unarmed human.

Collecting a POW item while in human form will restore the player's energy. If a POW is collected while wearing the suit, however, the player's energy will NOT be increased but their weapon will receive a power-up.

The game's platforms are littered with springboards that fire the player high into the air when stepped on. Some platforms - often containing POW items - can only be reached via a springboard.

		<desc>Armed Police Unit Gallop is a futuristic shoot-em-up from the creators of "R*Type" in which the player takes on the role of a futuristic policeman who must destroy criminal controlled ships. 

As with most Irem shoot-em-ups, Gallop's weapons system is superb. As well as being equipped with the standard front-firing gun and ground targeting missiles (both of which can be upgraded with the retrieval of power-ups), the player's ship is armed with a homing laser that, when activated, emits a constant laser stream towards whatever enemies and bonus capsules are on screen. The laser has an 'Overheat' meter that depletes while the laser is in use. Once the meter is emptied the laser will stop working. The meter gradually refills allowing the player to continue using the laser.

		<name>Gals Panic II (Asia) </name>
		<desc>Gals Panic II is a "Qix"-style adult puzzle game. The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.

There is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated. But unlike in the original, the bar is unaffected by revealing the silhouetted and un-silhouetted parts of the image.

After completing three rounds, there is a break-out styled mini-game where the player may gain an extra life if he clears the blocks before the time limit.

		<name>Gals Panic 4 (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Gals Panic 4 is a variant of the classic puzzle game qix where the player works to uncover the highlighted area of the play space to reveal a girl. Players select one of seven girls at the start of the game.  Each girl has three stages with each stage featuring a different background image to uncover. Players are given bombs to attack the enemies with and are rewarded with more bombs if they reveal a large section at one time. When a player reveals 80% of a girl the stage ends and the player is shown the entire background image. When a player reveals 100% of the girl in a stage, he is rewarded with a 'Showtime' interlude.  Unlike in later games, 'Showtime' sequences involve no nudity, they just show the girl in a bikini. The 'Showtime' image is the same for each level featuring the girl.

There is also a 2-player vs. game where both players work on separate images on a split screen and work to reveal their image first. When a player uses a bomb in this game, instead of attacking the enemy, it sends a sub-enemy to the other player's side.

		<desc>Gals Panic! is a "Qix"-style adult puzzle game.  The objective is to reveal 80% of the silhouetted girl's image within the time limit while avoiding the enemies.

To complicate things, there is a bar with a pointer at the top of the screen. If the pointer dips below a certain level (indicated by the change in color) the image will change to that of a monster. The pointer slowly creeps towards the monster side of the bar over time and whenever the player reveals a significant piece of the silhouette.  Revealing the un-silhouetted part of the image moves the pointer back towards the girl side of the bar.  If a round is completed while the monster's image is shown then the round must be repeated.

After every round there is a roulette game where the player can earn rewards or penalties that will take effect in the following round.

After winning three rounds against a girl, the graphic becomes a photographic image of that girl.

		<desc>.50!), but players were resistant to the increase. The question at Atari was: How do we get extra earnings? The idea with Gauntlet was that with four players you earn four times as much with every play. It was a drop-in/drop-out design so if someone died they could immediately rejoin or someone new could step in -- there was no down time, so the quarters just kept coming. Another choice made specifically to increase the coin drop: there was no end to the game. Gauntlet would recycle levels by flipping them horizontally and vertically once the players had run through all of them. Gauntlet was a big success in 1985. But the marketing team at Atari was actually worried about the four-player cabinet. They weren't sure four strangers would want to play a game together and they also had concerns about the four separate coin shoots (which were known to break easily). Confident in his game, Ed Logg convinced the marketing team to just go with it.

Another Gauntlet milestone was in the game's use of sound effects. Synthesized human voices had been used sporadically in games in the early eighties and while it had proved, on most occasions, to be moderately successful, was still considered something of a novelty. Gauntlet, however, revolutionized the concept of in-game speech and added immeasurably to the game's superb atmosphere. The deep timbre of Gauntlet's very own 'Dungeon Master' would guide players through the levels, informing them that 'Elf needs food, badly', or that 'Wizard is about to die' and the always-good advice that is 'Remember, don't shoot food.'

Note: The game contains exactly 212 sounds (including digitized voices, effects and musics).

It was common practice to test a new arcade game at select locations before wide release. The operator was given the cabinet for free, but in exchange they couldn't promote it (as a precaution against competition) and they would share the coin drop numbers of it and all the other machines at the location so that Atari could evaluate the new game's success against current games. But when Ed Logg came by to check on Gauntlet during its field test, he found developers from SEGA snapping photos of the cabinet. Atari pulled it from that location and didn't work with the operator henceforth. A year after Gauntlet's release in 1985, SEGA released a four-player arcade game called "Quartet" (although it was side-scrolling). 

7,848 units were sold in the U.S. A few thousand more were sold in Japan and Europe. Even though Atari considered Gauntlet a success, earlier games like "Space Invaders" and "Ms. Pac-Man" sold hundreds of thousands of cabinets. One of Gauntlet's contemporaries from Atari, the excellent Temple of Doom game, sold just 2,800 copies. 

Note : There were 20 officially released versions (see Updates section for detailed info), including 6 '2-player' versions and various Spanish, German and Japanese versions. Counting 4-player English variants alone, there were 7 releases with various bug-fixes.

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including GAUNTLET.

Charles Nagle holds the official record for this game with 4,401,169 points on March 28, 2003.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II : G.S.M. Atari Games 2 - PCCB-00070) on September 21, 1991.

It was a drop-in/drop-out design so if someone died they could immediately rejoin or someone new could step in -- there was no down time, so the quarters just kept coming. Another choice made specifically to increase the coin drop: there was no end to the game. Gauntlet would recycle levels by flipping them horizontally and vertically once the players had run through all of them. Gauntlet was a big success in 1985. But the marketing team at Atari was actually worried about the four-player cabinet. They weren't sure four strangers would want to play a game together and they also had concerns about the four separate coin shoots (which were known to break easily). Confident in his game, Ed Logg convinced the marketing team to just go with it.

Another Gauntlet milestone was in the game's use of sound effects. Synthesized human voices had been used sporadically in games in the early eighties and while it had proved, on most occasions, to be moderately successful, was still considered something of a novelty. Gauntlet, however, revolutionized the concept of in-game speech and added immeasurably to the game's superb atmosphere. The deep timbre of Gauntlet's very own 'Dungeon Master' would guide players through the levels, informing them that 'Elf needs food, badly', or that 'Wizard is about to die' and the always-good advice that is 'Remember, don't shoot food.'

Note: The game contains exactly 212 sounds (including digitized voices, effects and musics).

It was common practice to test a new arcade game at select locations before wide release. The operator was given the cabinet for free, but in exchange they couldn't promote it (as a precaution against competition) and they would share the coin drop numbers of it and all the other machines at the location so that Atari could evaluate the new game's success against current games. But when Ed Logg came by to check on Gauntlet during its field test, he found developers from SEGA snapping photos of the cabinet. Atari pulled it from that location and didn't work with the operator henceforth. A year after Gauntlet's release in 1985, SEGA released a four-player arcade game called "Quartet" (although it was side-scrolling). 

7,848 units were sold in the U.S. A few thousand more were sold in Japan and Europe. Even though Atari considered Gauntlet a success, earlier games like "Space Invaders" and "Ms. Pac-Man" sold hundreds of thousands of cabinets. One of Gauntlet's contemporaries from Atari, the excellent Temple of Doom game, sold just 2,800 copies. 

Note : There were 20 officially released versions (see Updates section for detailed info), including 6 '2-player' versions and various Spanish, German and Japanese versions. Counting 4-player English variants alone, there were 7 releases with various bug-fixes.

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including GAUNTLET.

Charles Nagle holds the official record for this game with 4,401,169 points on March 28, 2003.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II : G.S.M. Atari Games 2 - PCCB-00070) on September 21, 1991.

		<desc>Green Beret is a sideways-scrolling action/platform game set during the Cold War, in which a US Special Forces Marine must infiltrate a Russian military base to save four POW's from being executed by firing squad. 

Initially, the soldier is armed with only a combat knife, but by killing the certain enemy troops, players can obtain either a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. 

The Marine can jump or lie down to avoid the enemy bullets, as well as climbing ladders to avoid enemies and projectiles, as well as the flashing land mines that litter the levels. While it's possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage. 

The game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators. 

The game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty.

In this version:
- Characters prologue/story removed.
- Some vocals said by the characters Kazuya, Liza, Li-Huan and Jim McCoy (after they win a round, or before the fight begins) have been removed.
- The portraits of Kazuya, Liza and Li-Huan are different. Those were redrawn.
- Super moves removed.
- The title screen is also different, but strangely, the letter K from both words in the Kaiser Knuckle logo can still be seen in some of Global Champion's backgrounds.

		<name>G-Darius (Ver 2.01J) </name>
		<desc>G-Darius literally added a new dimension to the highly regarded 'Darius' series, with the introduction of fully 3D rendered backgrounds and enemies. Namco had already done the same with their Xevious series for "Xevious 3D/G", released two years' earlier, but G-Darius is generally regarded as the most accomplished of the two titles.

G-Darius' game-play was also enhanced, with the 'Capture Ball' system; this allowed the player to capture almost any enemy craft and use it against the game's other enemies. Captured enemies can either be detonated like a ''bomb'', damaging all enemies nearby; or used to fire a special 'Alpha Beam', which cuts through everything but gold-colored objects and enemy bosses. Each boss is capable of firing its own version of this beam at the player; when both beams meet, they will interrupt each other's path. Depending on how rapidly the player presses the Fire button, one beam will grow and eventually overpower the others. The Capture ball was actually introduced in "Darius Gaiden" but was only used to a minimal extent.

		<desc>The second arcade sequel to 1990's "Parodius Da!", this parody of Konami's "Gradius" series picks up where the first game left off. This time, it isn't only their own games that the Konami shoot-em-up mocks; other classics of the genre such as Irem's legendary "R*Type" - specifically the infamous mothership that forms R*Type's entire third level - are lovingly parodied.

Despite being heavily influenced by Konami's own "Track and Field" series, Gold Medalist lacks both the addictiveness and tight gameplay mechanics of the games upon which it is based. The nine disciplines, which can be attempted in any order, are :
* 100 Metre Sprint
* Long Jump
* Horizontal Bars
* Freestyle Swimming
* Boxing
* Discus
* 110m Hurdles
* High Jump
* 400m Relay

		<name>Golden Axe (set 6, US, 8751 317-123A) </name>
		<desc>Golden Axe is a side scrolling beat'em up by Telenet and conversion of Sega's popular arcade game. The evil lord Death Adder has come to threaten the peaceful land of Yuria. He now holds the king and his daughter captive in his castle, as well as the legendary Golden Axe which he intends to destroy if the people of Yuria don't crown him as the ruler of the country. Three warriors (also on a promise of personal revenge) set out on a long journey to defeat Death Adder and his motley army of mercenaries and undead monsters. Each fighter comes with a signature weapon and fighting techniques: Ax Battler is a muscular barbarian wielding a two-handed heavy sword, Tyris Flare is the only female of the group and carries a long-sword and Gilius Thunderhead is a dwarf armed with a sleek double axe. Each hero can also summon elementals to the party's aid - Ax posses the powers of the Earth, Tyris the powers of the Fire and Gilius the powers of the Lightning - and the more magic potions they collect and use, the more destructive the magic spells become. Another unique twist of Golden Axe is the ability given to the players to ride beasts, as long as their original owner can adequately be knocked off their ride first. All the rideable beasts come with special attacks, some use simple tail whips whereas others can breathe jets of fire. Golden Axe consists of eight stages but is single-player only.

		<desc>A platform game based on the 1985 Steven Spielberg movie of the same name. The player takes control of Mikey and must explore a variety of caverns and rooms, searching for the three keys needed to unlock the huge, metal door that bars progress to the next level. The keys are hidden behind a number of doors which can only be removed by placing a bomb in front of them and blowing them open. Mikey's progress is hampered by the many enemies that roam the levels. The bombs needed to blow the doors appear when certain enemies are killed.

A fellow 'Goonie' is trapped behind one of the doors on each level, and can be rescued, although this isn't necessary to progress to the next level. A catapult, or 'slingshot', can also be found, allowing Mikey to attack enemies from a safe distance.

		<name>Gorf </name>
		<desc>The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic "Space Invaders" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers five distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows : 

* Mission 1 - Astro Battles : The first mission is more or less a straight clone of "Space Invaders", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic forcefield, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The forcefield also works in BOTH directions, and therefore must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders. 

* Mission 2 - Laser Attack : The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to divebomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies. 

* Mission 3 - Galaxians : This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually divebomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians. 

* Mission 4 - Space Warp : A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies. 

* Mission 5, Flag Ship : The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own forcefield, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor. 

Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.

		<name>Gradius II - GOFER no Yabou (Japan New Ver.) </name>
		<desc>Gradius II is an horizontal shooter by Konami and conversion of their hit arcade game originally release in 1988. The Bacterion Empire has risen from its own ashes and is once more spreading doom and destruction throughout the universe. Led by the evil Gofer, the alien invasion now hits full swing and must be immediately stopped. The Vic Viper is back in service and ready to take on the upcoming threat. Gradius II retains the power-meter originally used in Gradius - the player collects power-pods left behind by orange enemies and moves onto the next available power-up from the meter. Upgrades range from Speed Up, Missiles, Double Shots, Multiples, Lasers and Shield. Unlike Gradius, this sequel offers four different power-meter configurations (available at the beginning of the game) which feature new weapons to choose from, such as the Tail Gun, Spread Bombs, Photo Torpedoes, Ripple Lasers and so forth. It also adds its own twist to the power system though, and some weapons can be activated twice for additional power - for instance, Missiles and Doubles can receive one upgrade each and Multiples can rotate around the Vic Viper for a short amount of time. Gradius II consists of seven stages and features an alternating two-player mode.

		<desc>Your task is to break Gravitar's hold on the 12 solar systems under his power. You can do this by destroying all bunkers on every planet or by setting off the reactor in the alien reactor base.

Each solar system consists of a killer sun, an alien reactor base, and three or four blockaded planets - each housing fuel deposits and enemy bunkers.

To move from one solar system to the next, you must either visit all the planets and destroy every enemy bunker or activate the reactor at the core of the alien reactor base and escape before it explodes.

When you complete your mission in the three solar systems of one galaxy, you are automatically transported to another galaxy, where your rescue mission will continue.

You start the game with 6 to 100 starships, depending on the game level, and with 10,000 fuel units. Your ship consumes fuel every time you use your thrust engines, activate your shields, or extend your tractor beam. A warning beep sounds when your fuel level goes below 2,000 units.

The game ends when you run out of fuel or lose all your spaceships. When you complete your mission, the game resets and your points continue to accumulate.

		<name>Gryzor (set 1) </name>
		<desc>In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien lifeform. Two years later in 2633, a terrorist organization of alien origin called Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.

Gryzor is a hectic 1 or 2-player platform shoot-em-up featuring five stages. Three of the levels are standard side-scrolling platform levels, while the remaining 2 are enemy 'bases'; 3rd person into-the-screen stages in which players must run down series of heavily defended corridors to reach and destroy an end-of-level boss, before moving onto the next stage.

Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are :
* Machine gun [M] : Auto-fire.
* Spread gun [S] : Allows the player to fire five shots in an arc.
* Laser gun [L] : Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.
* Fire Ball [F] : A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.
* Rapid-fire [R] : Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon.
* Barrier [B] : Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.

The game's 5 levels and bosses are as follows :
Stage 1 : Jungle – Defensive Wall – (horizontal scrolling)
Stage 2 : Base 01 – Six turrets and alien eyeball – (3rd-person)
Stage 3 : Waterfall – Large Alien – (vertical scrolling)
Stage 4 : Base 02 – Six turrets and alien head – (3rd-person)
Stage 5 : Snow Field/Energy Zone/Hangar/Alien Lair – Alien Heart – (horizontal scrolling)

		<desc>It is August 1999. In the skies over the Middle East, the second Persian Gulf War has begun. The early half of the 90's, the Persian Gulf War breaks out in the Middle East and prolonged fighting rapidly increases the rate of destruction of the world's natural resources. In 1999 this develops into a state of crisis where the effects of the war have resulted in an absolute shortage of reserves. Mistaken policies have resulted in the nation of the Middle East, suffering from shortages since the time of the original Persian Gulf War, taking military action against neighboring nations in an attempt to assure a supply of resources for themselves. Those nations which have managed to escape the fighting once again form a Multinational Force. Using the technology gained from research which had been done for a new type of nuclear reactor, they succeed in developing and producing GRID - a Gyrodrive Reactive Intercept Device. This is the start of Project Storm Hammer.

		<name>Gumbo </name>
		<desc>Gumbo is a "Columns"-style adult puzzle game featuring nude photographic and hand drawn images as a background to the playing field.  Columns of three blocks fall from the sky and the player can move the block left or right and shift the order of the blocks column falls. The objective is to match three or more blocks of the same type in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal rows in order to clear them from the play area. As the player clears more blocks the columns begin to descend at a more rapid rate.

As time progresses entire rows of blocks are added to the bottom of the play area. Occasionally after clearing a set of blocks (and more often after setting off chains of removing blocks) the bottom row of blocks will be removed from the play area. If necessary, the player can use a help which will change all of the blocks in the currently falling column into 'P' blocks. When the column lands on the stack of blocks, whichever block it falls on will be cleared from the screen, along with all blocks that match that block.  When the bottom row is removed from play a section is added to the progress bar at the bottom of the screen. When the progress bar is filled the stage is complete.

After clearing a stage, all of the remaining blocks are momentarily removed from the board and a bonus game begins.  In the bonus game the background image is broken up and shuffled around in a sliding puzzle game.  The progress bar at the bottom of the screen counts down the time left to return the tiles to their proper place and points are awarded for any extra time left after the game is completed.  Once the bonus game is over the background image is changed, the blocks remaining from the previous stage are returned to the screen and the game continues.

If the blocks reach the top of the screen where the columns are dropped from then the game is over.  Upon continuing all of the blocks are removed from play and the columns fall at the original speed.

		<name>Gunforce - Battle Fire Engulfed Terror Island (World) </name>
		<desc>Gunforce is a side scrolling action shooter developed by Bits and published by Irem, and it is the conversion of the arcade game of the same name. In the year 2000, a mysterious alien organization and its growing army starts to invade others countries and to incapacitate their computer networks, thus compromising their ability to launch their own counteroffensives. As a last resort, the allied forces decide to dispatch an elite commando team called the 'GunForce'. Their mission is simple - take down the enemy command and communications centers and to ultimately destroy their massive sea fortress. Each soldier can shoot in eight different directions and is equipped with a basic rifle gun that they can later upgrade into more deadly weapons. The power-ups, usually left behind by defeated enemies or hidden inside crates, range from an Automatic Weapon, a Bazooka, a Flamethrower and a Laser. But each special weapon comes with a significant limitation - ammunition. Although the default gun grants the player unlimited ammo, all the others have a set amount of bullets. Furthermore, the soldiers can use a broad selection of vehicles scattered around each level (such as jeeps, turrets, helicopters or armored biped walkers) and devastate the enemy with far superior firepower. Additionally, Gunforce features a bit of a twist on the traditional Run'n Gun formula - enemies don't kill outright on contact (as they usually do in myriad of other action games), but only their bullets or vehicles do. Gunforce consists of five levels and also features a two simultaneous player mode.

		<desc>The country is struggling under the cruel domination of its evil King. The rebel guerilla leader and his comrades attempt to secretly land on shore. The King's military is waiting for them, however, and the players must fight their way inland to reach and destroy the King's palace stronghold.

In this, the pseudo-sequel to SNK's own superb "Ikari Warriors" (released two years earlier), players must once again shoot their way through a number of vertically scrolling levels, all packed with large numbers of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and vehicles. Each level also contains a number of captured prisoners tied to wooden stakes, and these can be rescued for extra points. 

The players' weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition and additional ammo/grenades must be picked up along the way. A number of gun upgrades can also be found. At various points in the game, players can also enter unoccupied enemy tanks, which provide increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion occurs. Should the player be caught inside or near the tank when it explodes, a life is lost.

As with "Ikari Warriors", Guerrilla War features full 360 degree gameplay with attacking troops appearing from all directions. The players' on-screen counterparts are able to rotate themselves accordingly.

		<name>Gyruss (Centuri) </name>
		<desc>Gyruss is a single player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. 

It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. 

Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.

Hang-On's handling and superb graphics were unlike anything seen before in the arcades and, like many Yu Suzuki games that followed, revolutionised the racing genre.

Alps

This was the world first driving simulator to use 3-D polygon graphics. 

Despite claiming to be a real driving simulator, there were a lot of discrepancies between the game's software physics and the car physics on screen. However, the cockpit physics were considered very accurate at the time. 

You may have noticed that the Credit Screen lists Doug Milliken as a Test Driver (See Staff section). He is listed as a Test Driver because Atari didn't want anyone to know what he really did. Hard Drivin' had to be as accurate as possible. That meant doing an accurate car model to mathematically describe the physics of how the parts of the car (engine, transmission, springs, shock absorbers, tires, etc.) react to each other, to the road and to the driver's inputs. The pioneer in the field (in the 1950s) was William Milliken of Milliken Research. His son, Doug, has continued his father's work. Doug is probably the world's leading expert in car modelling. Doug and his father wrote the book on car modelling. 

Patents that come out of Hard Drivin' are : 
5005148 : 'Driving simulator with moving painted dashboard'. 
5354202 : 'System and method for driver training'. 
5577913 : 'System and method for driver training with multiple driver competition'. 

Prior to the release of Hard Drivin', Namco had acquired a controlling interest in Atari games by 1986. The sharing of R&amp;D information would spawn many games of the same polygon engine years later. It can be credited that the success of the Hard Drivin' engine set the trend for the high quality simulation games in the early 90's. 

One of the buildings along the speed course, a small camouflage-painted building, if approached from behind (a non-trivial task, given the off-road time limit) has a sign above its normally-unseen door that says 'THE HUT'. 

If the driver slowed down and stopped in front of one of the buildings, a 'keyhole' appeared on the building's door. 

There is no apparent Ferrari license shown in any version of the game. 

Jeff Garabedian holds the official record for this game with 531400 points at Aladdin's Castle at the Pontiac Mall in Waterford, MI in the summer of 1989. 

There were 15 officially released versions, counting 11 cockpit and 4 compact versions, including various British, German and Japanese versions.

		<desc>Heavy Barrel is a scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players, in which an army of terrorists have seized control of a nuclear missile facility. Players must infiltrate the heavily defended base and shoot their way through seven levels before reaching the final enemy Boss confrontation.

As with SNK's "Ikari" series, Heavy Barrel allows players to rotate their on-screen character and fire and move in all directions. Additional weapons and power-ups can be found, as well as keys which are used to open locked weapon containers that litter the levels.

In addition to the standard in-game weapons, the "Heavy Barrel" gun of the game's title also features. This must be assembled by collecting six different components (found in locked weapon containers). Once completed, the Heavy Barrel gives the player incredible firepower and instantly destroys anything it hits (with the exception of end-of-level bosses, which take several hits), although the Heavy Barrel only lasts for a period of thirty seconds, as indicated by a depleting red bar displayed at the top of the screen.

All bombs are replenished for the start of the next stage.

		<desc>Up to four players race each other over a variety of different surfaces on a selection of narrow, twisting roads, in this scrolling top-down racing game from Sega.

Each player's vehicle has a fuel (gas) meter that constantly depletes as the race progresses. Extra fuel (and bonus pick-ups) are placed at regular intervals on each track and can be collected by driving over them. If a car runs out of fuel it is automatically disqualified from the race.

During races the track scrolls to follow the current race leader. If the last-placed driver falls too far behind the leader and allows the scrolling area to catch up with them, their car is automatically transported further up the track, resulting in a fuel penalty.

There are always four cars competing in each race (with computer-controlled cars replacing any positions not filled by human players). Any driver finishing in the Top three is awarded bonus points, with the amount determined on whether they have finished 1st, 2nd or 3rd. These points can be used to buy a variety of car upgrades in the garage shop that appears at the end of every race. The upgrades available are; engine, tyre, wing and bumper. These affect speed, handling and durability. Particular attention should be paid to tyre choice, as different tyres are suited to specific race surfaces.

* Alien Ball In Power Training Session : Go to the Power Training Session and hit all 50 volleyballs. Then, an alien-like ball with veins and teeth will be thrown at your head. If you miss, it will bite your face, but if you hit it, you'll receive an additional 10% increment, for a grand total of a 30% power increment.

* Moai Mask : Sometimes the referee will be wearing a mask of Moai, the stone head from Parodius and Cue Brick. I haven't confirmed what triggers this particular trick, but I think it could have something to do with the timer. -Maybe winning at 2 :22, 1 :11, or something like that-

* Alternate Credits Roll : Beat the game in New or Powerful World mode. When the credits roll, the names will remain the same but the titles will be different. 'Making of this game' is replaced by 'Staff of Conjax Pro'. Also, keep an eye out for a cameo by Pentarou the penguin from Parodius during either credits roll.

* The Mob Never Forgives : When you win the game and get the park scene, look carefully in the background to spot two hit men armed with UZIs and gunning down a poor guy. The girl next to him tries to run. Is this subliminal violence??

		<name>Hunchback (set 1) </name>
		<desc>Hunchback is a classic and much-copied platform game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous bell-ringer, Quasimodo, in his quest to rescue the beautiful Esmeralda from the tower of the castle fortress.

To reach Esmeralda, Quasi must run and jump through a number of screens - each representing part of a castle wall - to reach the tower and complete his rescue. Each screen presents the player with a different set of platform-based obstacles. These range from spear-toting guards, to ramparts and fiery chasms (the latter of which is cleared by carefully timed jumps onto and off a constantly swinging rope).

Most of the game's screens also feature projectiles - in the form of fireballs and arrows - that must be avoided. These can appear from both the left and right-hand side of the screen and can be moving at one of two different heights and speeds. Some of the trickier screens contain more than one of these projectiles and contact with either a projectile or guard will result in Quasi falling from the castle wall, resulting in the loss of a player life.

To complicate matters further, each screen must be completed within a strict time limit. This takes the form of an enemy guard climbing the castle walls; if the guard reaches the top of the wall, he will walk towards Quasi to burn the Hunchback with his torch. If Quasi rings the bell before the guard has scaled the wall, a bonus score is rewarded. If five screens are completed without a life being lost, a 'Super Bonus' is awarded.

A meter at the bottom left corner of the screen - displaying a cutaway of castle ramparts - shows Quasi's progress towards the tower and his beloved Esmeralda. Upon reaching Esmeralda, players must complete a bonus screen - involving using moving ropes to collect bells from a series of platforms - to complete the rescue.

Once completed, the game starts over with a much higher level of difficulty and tighter time limits.

Points: 
Deliver Cargo: 10,000
Landing on disc in Bonus Dome: 1000 to 20,000
Collect Fire Ring: 200 to 10,000
Sink Ship: 5000
Destroy Flying Jet: 3000

Destroy Black Shawdon Boat: 100

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Learn to recognize cargo as it float in the water. Otherwise, you will not get paid. Without money, you cannot strengthen your craft. That means you will probably be creamed by enemy missiles.

* Get as much fuel as possible. Without it, you don't stand a chance.

* Know when to fly, and when to stay low. There are a few things in life more frustrating than missing all the money bags because you are in the wrong place at the wrong time.

* Shoot enemy craft whenever possible. The rewards are great.

		<desc>This is an updated version of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man", featuring forced-perspective 3-D graphics that allow the players to jump over the enemy ghosts; in a similar fashion to Namco's "Pac-Mania", released in 1987. There are secret items and food to be found on each level that increases the player's power and score. The power-ups themselves consist of a shield, helmet lasers, speed and jump shoes. Players will face a boss encounter every ten stages and the game ends after the 30th stage.

		<desc>Go for the Gold in Konami's newest kit, Hyper Sports Special. Feel the thrill of competition as you test your Olympic skills against other world-class athletes. The Bronze is not enough, and even the Silver won't cut it - you are going for the Gold! However, you must at least qualify in each event in order to compete in the next event. 

Get pumped up to compete in the following events : 

1) 100m Dash : Race against the other athletes as well as the clock. This is just a warm-up compared to the events to come. 

2) Long Jump : Player dashes to the line, leaps, and propels his body as far as he is able. The player controls the speed and angle of the jump. 

3) 400m Relay (Qualifying Heat) : Speed and timing are crucial in this event. Player must coordinate the baton hand-off perfectly for the best qualifying time. 

4) Skeet Shooting : Player can aim left and right at the clay pigeons and must prove that he is a sure shot. A chance for bonus points is given for excellent marksmanship. 

5) 110m Hurdles : Player sprints down the track, timing his jumps perfectly to clear all of the hurdles and reach the finish line in time. 

6) Archery : This is a trial of the player's proficiency in using a bow and arrow. The player can decide the direction and force of the wind, which will help in demonstrating his skill as a sharpshooter. 

7) Javelin Throw : The player darts to the line and throws the javelin with all his might. The player controls the height of the javelin. 

8) High Jump : Another test of speed and strength as the player runs to the line and hurls his body over the bar. The player can control his angle above the bar. 

9) 400m Relay - The Final Race : The final test of physical training as the player faces the challenging relay again. 

GO FOR THE GOLD!

		<desc>SNK's answer to Capcom's 'Commando', released a year earlier, one or two players take on the role of a 'Rambo-esque' soldier as they fight on land and water to reach the village of Ikari. most of the action takes place on foot, although players will occasionally stumble across unoccupied enemy tanks which can be entered and driven. Standing between the players and their destination are a multitude of enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and static gun emplacements.

Each different enemy soldier-type is equipped with a different weapon, such as a semi-automatic machine gun, automatic machine gun, grenades, and super grenades. To assist the players in their struggle, a number of power-ups can be picked up, such as extended shot range and hand-grenades. As the players' munitions are depletable, additional ammo/grenades must to be picked up along the way. players can also enter tanks, which offer increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to leave the tank before the explosion takes place. Should the player be caught inside when the tank explodes, a life is lost.

Unlike Capcom's 'Commando', Ikari features 360 degree gameplay, as a result of this the home conversions could never hope to match the arcade machine's rotary joystick controls.

		<name>Image Fight (World, revision A) </name>
		<desc>Image Fight is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with an original premise. The game's first five stages are supposed to be a 'simulation' and serve as training to test the player's abilities. Player's will receive a penalty if their hit-ratio is too low.

Once players have proved themselves on the opening stages, they will progress to the game's last three stages, blasting off into space on a mission to destroy the alien vegetation surrounding the Moon's main computer. If the player fails in the mission, they must endure the dreaded 'Penalty Zone'. Features a high level of challenge, a wide variety of weapons and the ability to change speed.

If the player's ship is equipped with one or more red/blue extra guns, pushing both Action buttons simultaneously will sling the guns forward in a boomerang-like fashion. This is a powerful and destructive method and can be done an unlimited number of times.

		<desc>Imekura Mahjong is an adult mahjong game with six live-action AV actresses as opponents.  Imekura Mahjong is not exactly a strip mahjong game as many of the girls start out nude in their first "strip" scene, with following scenes featuring the girls in more suggestive poses.

An adult scene is shown every time the player wins a hand.  Each girl features three adult scenes, the first two consisting of a still image, and the last featuring a super low frame-rate video.  If a girls betting funds are completely depleted, then all of her remaining adult scenes are shown.

The player loses the game once all of his betting funds are depleted.

		<name>Inferno (Williams) </name>
		<desc>Players walk around a 3-quarters perspective maze shooting at various enemies. After shooting an enemy the enemy's 'soul' (a dark version of itself) attempts to make its way to the top of the screen to an awaiting monster mouth. The player must touch the enemy soul before it gets there or a more difficult enemy is regenerated.

Inferno's maze layout is somewhat similar to Crystal Castles, but without the wide changes in maze height. There seems to be only 3 or 4 'heights' of the maze, which the player can reach via small stairways.

Theme music and sound effects are from the movie of the same name. This is the first Atari System I game to use speech capability to talk to players.

Official world records for this game (for each difficulty and number of starting lives) are :
Hard (7 lives) : Cliff Reese with 1,993,530 points
Hard (3 lives) : Cliff Reese with 1,410,930 points
Med. (3 lives) : Cliff Reese with 945,070 points
Easy (3 lives) : Cliff Reese with 800,000 points

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

At the difficulty select screen, whip all the hanging skeletons and both snakes to receive a 5,000 point 'Completion Bonus'. Whipping all the gas cannisters in the mines stage gives a 'Pyro Bonus' and whipping every bone pile and snake in the altar stage also gives a bonus. On levels which feature pits of molten lava, whipping enemy guards until they fall in the lava will earn additional bonus points.

		<name>I, Robot </name>
		<desc>I, Robot is a 3-D shoot-em-up in which the player controls the "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984"; a servant robot who has become self-aware and decided to rebel against the all-controlling Big Brother and his ever-watchful 'Evil Eyes'.

The game is set over a series of platform-based stages constructed from solid coloured blocks and to complete a stage, players must "eliminate the red zones". This is achieved by moving the robot over all of a stage's red surfaces, changing their colour to blue. The colour scheme - including target colour - changes every 26 levels, however. So while the target colour is red for the first 26 screens, it becomes yellow from Level 27, blue from Level 53 and magenta from Level 79.

In order to reach all of the platforms and surfaces, the Interface robot will need to jump. This must be carefully timed, however, as jumping is not allowed under Big Brother's strict regime and his Evil eye - sitting atop a pyramid at the back of the playfield - will open at regular intervals to watch over the interface robot. Should the eye be fully open - indicated by it turning red - when the robot is mid-jump, he will be spotted and destroyed, costing the player a life.

Once all of the coloured squares on a stage have been eliminated, the enemy's shield is destroyed and the Interface Robot will need to be guided to a final, previously inaccessible coloured square at the back of the playfield. The Evil Eye is then zapped and destroyed.

Some levels feature different background elements that affect gameplay, such as walls that must be shot and destroyed to reach coloured tiles, or indestructible moving columns that intermittently block access to coloured tiles, making timing difficult. There are also enemies to be shot or avoided, including birds, bombs and flying sharks.

Once the eye has been beaten, Interface Robot automatically jumps to the top of the pyramid and launches itself into space. A short inter-level "Space Wave" to the next stage follows. These stages feature polygonal objects hurling through space that must be either avoided or destroyed.

Every third level contains a red pyramid that must entered once all coloured squares are eliminated. Once inside, the Robot has one chance to collect as many bonus jewels as possible before destroying the Evil Eye. If the Robot is destroyed while inside the pyramid, he is immediately thrust back into space. The player must then battle through three more levels and destroy a further three Evil Eyes before getting another chance to collect any high scoring pyramid jewels.

After every fourth level, the Space Wave stage features a battle with Big Brother himself, shown as a huge, disembodied polygonal head. Big Brother constantly spits cone-shaped projectiles from his mouth and every single one of these must be shot or they will collide with and kill the player.

The head can be forced to rotate by repeatedly shooting the side of its face. If the head isn't facing the robot, danger is minimized since he won't fire his cone-shaped projectiles when facing away. Players must simply survive this encounter for about 20 seconds, after which Big Brother flies away and the next level begins.

I, Robot features 126 stages, with 26 unique level designs. After level 26, the designs repeat at a higher difficulty level and with an altered colour palette. The on-screen level counter is only two digits, so levels 100–126 are displayed as 0–26 respectively. On passing level 126, the player gets thrown back to a random earlier level.

Once the game is underway, pressing the one-player Start button will incrementally zooms the game's camera closer in to the action, while the two-player Start button pulls it further back, offering new viewing angles of the playfield. Closer camera angles result in higher score multipliers, due to the increased difficulty of visibility. In later levels, enemies known as "Viewer Killers" directly attack the player rather than the robot, forcing players to either switch camera angles, or move the robot to scroll the camera away from the Viewer Killers

'I, Robot' was - in both technical and design terms - ahead of its time and the game featured many new and ground-breaking innovations that the games industry would later adopt. The most striking and obvious of these was the game's graphics. While 'I, Robot' wasn't the world's first three-dimensional game, it was the first to feature solid, filled-polygon graphics, as opposed to the wire-frame graphics adopted by earlier titles. The concept of players being able to switch viewpoints also appeared here first.

The final innovation was 'Doodle City'. Instead of playing the game, players could instead choose to use the game's colourful three-dimensional objects to draw pictures on the monitor screen. Doodle City lasts for three minutes per credit, although players can switch back to playing 'I, Robot' at any time. When switching back to the game, the number of lives the player has is dictated by how much time was spent on Doodle City, with one life taken away for every minute in the "Ungame" mode.

You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen 1 right to screen 4.
* The 1st screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).
* In the 2nd screen, Jack manuevers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.
* The 3rd screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.
* On the 4th screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.
* The 5th screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).

After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.

		<name>Jack the Giantkiller (set 2) </name>
		<desc>This game plays a lot like "Donkey Kong" except that the controls are not quite as smooth. There are 5 screens to master if you want to help Jack in his mission. You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen 1 right to screen 4.
* The 1st screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).
* In the 2nd screen, Jack manuevers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.
* The 3rd screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.
* On the 4th screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.
* The 5th screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).

After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.

		<desc>1 or 2 players operate a jeep and must battle their way through a huge, vertically scrolling battlefield. Their mission is to save PoWs and deliver them to the nearest helicopter pad so they can be flown to safety. The hostages are trapped in enemy buildings and PoW camps, which must be destroyed in order to release the prisoners. The jeep can only carry up to a maximum of eight PoWs, the current amount being carried is displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.

The jeep is armed with a machine gun and a grenade thrower, the latter of which can be powered-up into a missile launcher. As well as huge numbers of enemy troops and static gun emplacements, the players must also contend with enemy jeeps, tanks, boats, submarines and planes. The final part of the game takes place in the enemy stronghold and the game ends when the final enemy gun emplacements are destroyed.

		<desc>Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. 

The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. 

A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. 

Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. 

Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.

		<name>Joyful Road (Japan) </name>
		<desc>A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.

The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive.

		<name>Joust 2 - Survival of the Fittest </name>
		<desc>On the planet of the floating cliffs, society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a Joust... where only the fittest survive! 

The legend of "Joust" continues in Joust 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of Joust 2's 35 different backgrounds. 

The object of Joust 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (joust), the Gladiator's lance must be higher. 

Defeating a Buzzard Enemy in a Joust causes release of an Egg. Eggs may be caught in the air or collected on landing areas for bonus points. Be Careful! Eggs falling into the Lava form into aggressive mutants, while uncollected Eggs hatch into dangerous warriors. 

Danger lurks everywhere! Giant Statues come to life; Bats fall out of crystals embedded in the rocks; Lava Trolls and Water Monsters eat unsuspecting bird-mounts; Lightning fills the air; and Unbeatable? Pterodactyls patrol the skies. A gigantic Knight presides on several waves. You, the Gladiator, must destroy him! Hitting all four of his red pins explodes the Knight and all his servants. 

Gold Egg Feature : A Gold Egg may randomly appear on any wave. Collecting the Gold Egg before it hatches opens a window of awards in the background. To collect an award, step on the red button above the window before a timer expires. Both players reap the benefits of the posted award, which may include bonuses of 1,000 to 10,000 points, 'super zapping' all enemies on the screen, or even receiving an extra life. 

Prepare thyself for War! 

Buy-In : Joust 2 is designed for action entertainment for one or two simultaneous players. Players who have started the game may continue where they left off by using the buy-in feature. When a player has used all of his lives, he will hear : "Wish to continue?" A 10-second timer appears in the players score area to allow the game to continue by using a Credit, or inserting a coin, before the player presses the Start button. 

Level Selection : At the beginning of a game, the player selects, via the Flap button, one of six different waves, corresponding to the player's skill level. Then, pressing the Start button begins the game. If the player wins the starting wave, he receives an award of points, approximating the scoring from preceding waves.

		<name>Jr. Pac-Man </name>
		<desc>One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide. 

This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life. 

The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts. 

As with previous "Pac-Man" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in "Ms. Pac-Man". Jr. Pac-Man's story tells of the blossoming love between Jr. Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum. 

Act I - Jr. Meets Yum-Yum : Jr. Pac-Man steps outside his home to play. He spots Yum-Yum beyond the fence in his yard and goes outside to meet her. Blinky, hiding in the shadows, comes out from hiding to catch Jr. However Ms. Pac-Man, keeping a watchful eye over her child, sees the commotion from her window and runs out to the yard to eat a Power Pill and chase both ghosts away while Jr. returns to the safety of home. This intermission is played after Round 1. 

Act II - The Gift : It seems that Jr. can't get the enchanting young ghost out of his mind, so he proceeds to bring a balloon to her as a gift the next day. Excited to see her, he meets her on a bridge and hands her the balloon, when we catch a glimpse of Blinky lurking behind a bush. This intermission is played after Round 3. 

Act III - They Escape : Blinky moves from one bush to the another, startling Yum-Yum into releasing the balloon. Blinky attempts to capture Jr. once and for all, but once again, Ms. Pac-Man comes to the rescue. Blinky chases her off to the left, while Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum escape to the right. Once alone, they gaze in to each other's eyes and fall in love, with hearts appearing all around them. This intermission is played after Rounds 5, 7, and 9.

		<name>Jungle King (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Jungle King is a jungle adventure game where players take on the role of Jungle King, a Tarzan-like jungle man, who is going in search of his Jungle Princess, who has been kidnapped by a pair of barbaric cannibals. 

Jungle King has four stages, each with its own unique scenarios, so each stage could be considered a separate game in its own right. 

It is noticable that this game scrolls from right to left, while the vast majority of scrollers go from left to right, although most people probably wouldn't even notice that. 

Jungle King's gameplay is very similar to that of Activision's "Pitfall", a classic arcade game released on many home computer and console formats of the time. 

The game's stages are as follows : 
* The first stage, which may have been the best stage in the game, is set in a forest with a series of swinging vines. Players must use the JUMP button to move from right to left across the vines, while avoiding the monkeys that can send Jungle King falling to the ground. This level is easy to master, but players must time their jumps carefully to make it to the next vine. 
* The second stage is set under a jungle river. Players must guide Jungle King through a river infestest with alligators and crocodiles. This stage features a 'breath meter' that must be carefully watched to avoid drowning (players simply swim up to the surface to get more air). Jungle King is armed with a knife with which he can stab the crocs and gators, but this can only be done when their mouths are not fully open. 
* The third stage is an avalanche with boulders rolling down a hill. The player simply uses the joystick to control Jungle King's climbing speed up the hill, and the JUMP button to leap over rolling boulders until they reach the end of the stage. 
* The fourth and final stage has the player guiding Jungle King through a cannibal village. Jungle King must jump over the cannibals while their spears are down, and eventually make his way towards his Jungle Princess, who is being lowered into a pot to be boiled for supper. 

On completion of the game, players are rewarded with a short 'I Love You' ending, and then the game begins again with increased difficulty.

		<name>Kaiser Knuckle (Ver 2.1O 1994/07/29) </name>
		<desc>A one-on-one fighting game featuring nine selectable characters and three end bosses, controlled with a single joystick and six buttons. In addition to the usual kicks and punches, each character also has a number of special moves, that can be utilized via complex joystick and button combinations. In the one player game, players can chose their first opponent, with subsequent opponents chosen randomly by the game.

Unusually for a game of this type, Kaiser Knuckle features blood; something that had hitherto only been associated with Midway's "Mortal Kombat" series. The blood option can be switched off in the game's dip settings.

Kaiser Knuckle was Taito's answer to Capcom's Street Fighter II during the fighting game trend of the 90s. Despite showing highly detailed and unique content in the arcades, it didn't catch enough attention to become a success and was never ported to home consoles.

A unique feature is that this was the first and only fighting game to feature five different strength for basic punches and kicks.

Another unique feature are power zones, these are activated when landing a special move when a character's Power (Crush in the Japanese version) meter is full. Power zones contain electricity or fire that can help improve a character's special move. Stage backgrounds can also be destroyed by the combat, getting hit fills the Power meter and when a special move connects when it is full, it greatly damages the background walls and can unlock the fire or electric zones found in levels.

		<name>Kaitei Daisensou (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Kaitei Daisensou is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two-players. Each player takes control of a submarine and must shoot their way through the game's six levels as they are attacked from both beneath the water in which the submarine moves (by enemy subs, gun emplacements, mines etc.), as well from above the water-line, by boats, jet fighters and helicopters. Numerous power-ups can be collected to boost the sub's meagre fire-power. 

This is a superb game, created by the ame team behind the legendary "R*Type" series. The superbly-rendered graphics are very similar in style to Irem's "R*Type Leo", released a year earlier. Kaitei Daisensou would prove to be Irem's last 'traditional' arcade shoot'em up, although two further R*Type sequels were released for home consoles (see R*Type Series section for more info).

		<name>Karate Blazers (World) </name>
		<desc>A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and punching, each character also has their own unique 'special attack'; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player's health.

While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.

		<name>The Karate Tournament </name>
		<desc>Karate Tournament is a one-on-one fighting game for one or two players, based on the ancient and most well known of martial arts, Karate.

Players enter a karate tournament - having first selected their preferred skill level, from either White, Brown or Black belt - and fight against a number of progressively tougher opponents. Each victory awards the player with a higher belt grade within their current belt colour - white grade six to white grade five, for example - and if the player wins the tournament, he or she is awarded a higher belt colour and the game ends. If players chooses to play the game on the 'Black Belt' skill level, defeating opponents is awarded with a higher grade, or 'dan' of Black Belt.

Karate Tournament uses a distinctive graphical technique in that it 'morphs' some of the combatants' movement graphics to simulate speed and motion blur. The game was also unique upon its release in that, in a world of "Street Fighters" and "Mortal Kombats" - replete with fantastical special moves - Karate Tournament was a genuine simulation of a recognized martial art; something not really seen since the first appearance of Data East's legendary genre-defining fighter, "Karate Champ", released eight years' earlier in 1984.

		<name>Karnov's Revenge / Fighter's History Dynamite </name>
		<desc>The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious "K", is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER'S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!!

Don't just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first "Fighter's History", this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie's).

The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a 'SFII clone' given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em ups on the Neo Geo this changed.

A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat'em up.

Karate Champ's control system utilised a somewhat awkward dual joystick control system, with simultaneous joystick manipulation required to execute even the simplest of kicks.

		<desc>Kiki Kaikai is a top-down action game by Taito and conversion of their own arcade game originally released back in 1986. The protagonist of the game is a cute little girl called Sayo and her duty is to rescue her family members from the Dark World. Each stage is populated by creatures borrowed from Japanese mythology and folklore and Sayo must find the key hidden someplace in the area and guarded by a vicious boss. But Sayo Chan is not empty-handed and she has two weapons at her disposal - her magic duster-wand is quite effective in close combat but her long range magic cards are definitely the meat of the game. Flying ghosts, skeletons and zombies won't stand a chance against fully-powered magic cards and Sayo can upgrade them in many ways. Powerful magic balls can also be collected along the way and they can destroy everything on screen in the blink of an eye (press I and II simultaneously to release them). Finally, the game is far from linear and later stages offer different routes.

The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.

Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.

		<name>Kirameki Star Road (Ver 2.10J 1997/08/29) </name>
		<desc>Kirameki Star Road is a music trivia game for one or two players where the player assumes the role of a music talent scout. At the start of the game the player chooses one of three girls to promote as a new music idol.  The object of the game is to listen to a piece of popular music and select the correct musician or title for the song before the timer runs out. After getting a set number of questions right, the player will be rated on their performance and will be shown how the girls popularity is advancing within certain demographics.

At each new stage the player gets to pick the genre from which the music selections will be pooled from and also gets to see the selected girl in a new costume. In the first stage the girl is scouted in her school uniform, the second stage involves a swimsuit audition, and later stage costumes are decided by the genre of music selected for that stage.

At certain stages in the game, the player is treated to a mini-game instead of the usual trivia.  Stage three is a dance stage, where the player is shown a combination of joystick and button moves and must then repeat them from memory.  Stage six is a photo shoot stage, where the player must attempt to frame the girl in a series of photos as the camera quickly shifts around. And Stage eight requires the player to shake off nosy tabloid paparazzi.

Each mistake in the trivia or mini games leads to a lost life.  The game is over once a player looses all their lives.

		<desc>Ryuusei Janshi Kirara Star is a strip mahjong game with a space-anime theme and very extensive animation. The game features three girls with two strip sequences each. The game allows the player to select the first opponent, but following opponents are played in sequence.

As a unique feature, not every winning hand played by the player will lead to a strip sequence. Lesser winning hands will instead add time to a quiz game that can be played between hands. The game will display how many seconds of playtime the player has earned for the quiz game and the player can select whether to attempt the quiz sequence, or skip ahead to the next hand and earn a longer time limit.

Correct answers given during the quiz game will remove panels placed over the girls image. If the player removes all of the panels before the timer runs out then the next strip sequence will be revealed. Failing this, if the player correctly answered any questions during the quiz sequence they will be awarded a cheat item for use in the next hand.

The game is over when a player runs out of betting funds.

		<desc>You've selected your level, and now the colored tiles start to tumble down the ramp. you zoom your paddle back and forth to catch the tiles and flip them into the bins to create rows of same colored tiles, The rows can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal, and three or more tiles ina row create a Klax.

Sounds Easy, right? It is, until the tiles speed up and tumble down the ramp so fast you can barely keep up! Faster and faster, your paddle becomes a blur as you struggle to keep up with the pace. Will you ace the wave or are you destined to fail? Either way, you'll find yourself quickly addicted to the good klean fun of tic-tac-KLAX!

The object  of the game is to accurately place colored tiles that tumble faster and faster down the ramp. To earn points and to progress from level to level, you must place the tiles in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal patterns called Klaxs. Three or more same colored tiles in a row is a Klax.

The colored tiles advance down the ramp toward a paddle that you control with the joystick. You must move the paddle back and forth in the paddle slide to catch the tumbling tiles as they arrive at the bottom of the ramp. Move the paddle by pushing the joystick right or left. The tiles fall onto the paddle. You can stack a maximum of five tiles on your paddle at a time.

To form Klaxs you must flip tiles into five bins below the paddle slide. To flip a tile from the paddle into a bin, position the paddle over the desired bin and press the fir button. The top tile on your paddle flips into the bin.

Each time you make a Klax the entire Klax highlights and disappears from the bins. That gives you more room to place more tiles. You receive points for every Klax you complete. If you plan ahead and create more complex Klaxs, you earn more points. You also receive points for empty spaces left in the bins and for any tiles left on the ramp when you complete a wave.

Use wild tiles (which count as any color) to complete especially complex Klaxs. Wild tiles flash multiple colors in turn as they tumble down the ramp.

You can also make the tiles come down the ramp more quickly. Just pull the joystick toward you to increase the speed of the tiles.

If you don't  want a particular tile on your paddle anymore, or you want to rearrange the tiles on your paddle, push forward on the joystick to flip the top tile back up the ramp. but be careful! You don't want too many tiles on the ramp at one time. If your paddle is full, or you don't get to a tile in tile,the tile falls into a deadly drop zone. You don't want that on your consience, do you? And if too many tiles fall into the drop zone abyss, it's the end of the game.

Each of the 100 Klax waves has an objective. The objective is displayed before you begin each level. On some waves you must archieve a certain number of horizontal or diagonal Klaxs. Some waves require you to survive a number of tiles any way you can, placing the tiles quickly to make Klaxs and freeing up space in the bins for the tumbeling tiles. Still other waves require you to earna certain number of points.

Tiles move faster and faster and you become more and more frantic to place them before they fall into the drop zone. The game ends if you fill up all 25 spaces in the bins before you have completed the level objective, or if you let too many tiles fall of the ramp.

If you fail to successfully complete a wave, you will be given the choice of continuing or starting over. Move the joystick up or down to move the arrow next to your selection, and press the fire button. Starting over returns you to the Title screen. continuing allows you to try the level again.

		<name>The King of Dragons (Japan 910805, B-Board 90629B-3) </name>
		<desc>The King Of Dragons is a side scrolling Beat 'em up and is one of Capcom's long series of side-scrolling beat' em ups that flooded the arcades back in the 1990s. This title is however rather unusual and takes place in a fantasy world populated with beefy warriors and evil dragons. The world is devastated by a red and ferocious dragon and the game spreads along no less than fifteen stages. Five playable characters are available from the start : the strong warrior, the cleric, the magical wizard, the light elf and the heavy dwarf. Obviously, each character has its own strengths and weaknesses and they can receive various upgrades throughout the game in the shape of new weapons, shields or new staffs. They can also level-up and consequently increase their life bars. Heroic fantasy games wouldn't be complete without magic, and magic there is - simple lightning bolt attacks can be triggered by any player and can damage several enemies at once. It is interesting to notice that a two simultaneous player option is available.

		<desc>With your super kung-fu skills, penetrate the enemy's headquarters to rescue the Chris family.

At the end of the 20th century, the world has gone through vast changes. Country borders around the world are constantly changing and every day brings further territorial expansion and new threats of power struggles. 

A member of the World Secret Police Organization (WSPO) has obtained information about an upcoming coup, but before it could be turned over to the WSPO he and his daughter were captured. Before his capture he was able to send a detailed letter to his counterpart in the People's Republic of China, code-named Kuri Kinton, along with a plea for help. 

It's all up to Kuri Kinton now to save the captives and restore the delicate balance of power.

		<desc>In Lady Bug you guide a bug through a "Pac-Man" style maze, eating dots, and avoiding monsters. Collect letters to spell EXTRA for a bonus life (just like in "Mr. Do!"), and SPECIAL for an extra credit. The maze has rotating doors which are just enough to give the game a slightly different feel than the Pac-Man series.

		<name>Lady Killer </name>
		<desc>Lady killer is an adult, puzzle game featuring eight sexy women.  The objective of the game is to dive and leap through the surface of the play area to reveal the image of the girl underneath.

At the start of each level the player gets to select which girl he wants to reveal.  Her image is then shown and is then covered by the game board.  Then the level begins. The player must move to avoid the enemies while attempting to flip the tiles on the board by diving and surfacing through them.  Flipped tiles often reveal power-ups to help the player. The player is killed any time he touches or is shot by an enemy, but the player can kill enemies by flipping a tile that the enemy is standing on. Enemies will re-spawn until the level is completed. The level is completed once all of the tiles have been removed.

Each girl features five states of undress and four stages. During gameplay, the girl's silhouette remains visible through the surface of the game play area and while her state of dress changes between stages, her pose and silhouette will remain the same. Each girl also has a special stage featuring a mini-game of a sliding tile game or a number selecting game. After completing the final stage for each girl, the player is shown an erotic scene for that girl and the player must wiggle the joystick left and right to advance the scene.

The game is over when the player has lost all of his lives.  Upon continuing the player restarts the level he is currently on.

		<desc>You have an overhead view of a maze with two sides, the sides mirror each other. The left side of the screen is yellow, and the right side is green. On each side are fifteen tanks. The object is to blow up all of the opposing players tanks (or as many as you can before the timer runs out). You can only control one tank at a time, you can move them around and blast your opponents tanks (getting the active one is usually a good idea). When you get blasted, your tank vanishes, and you must move a little blip over to another tank to resume play (this blip is invisible unless it is against a wall). You can also leave your tank and head for another one by pressing the second button. This is just a great strategic title, it holds up even today. It is really worth playing if you like that sort of thing. Just be aware that this is a two player only title, so you will need a friend to play against.

		<desc>A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.

The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.

The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.

		<name>Lethal Enforcers II: Gun Fighters (ver UAA) </name>
		<desc>Western style shooting game featuring digitized characters. The game consists of 5 stages : Bank Robbery, Stage Hold-Up, Saloon Showdown, Train Robbery, and Hide-Out. 

The player begins the game holding the rank of Sheriff, but if too many innocents or fellow lawmen are killed, the player can be demoted to Deputy or even Posse member. Complete a stage without killing any innocents, and the player is promoted to Deputy Marshal, further success can eventually lead to the player being promoted to the level of U.S. Marshal.

The player's gun can hold up to 6 bullets at a time. On each stage, there are special items that can be shot to reveal better weaponry, such as double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps, shotguns, gatling guns and cannon. The gatling guns and cannon can only be used once but the double rigs, rifles, 50 caliber sharps and shotguns can be reloaded the same way as your regular 6-gun. Once a life is lost, any additional weapons are lost and the player is once again armed with only a 6-gun.

		<name>Legion - Spinner-87 (World ver 2.03) </name>
		<desc>Legion is a horizontal shooter by Telenet and Renovation. The player takes control of a small spaceship and fights his way through a horde of enemy ships and facilities. The space-fighter starts off with a simple vulcan gun and there is a total of three powerup weapons available : vulcan-gun (red), laser (green) and homing-missiles (blue). There is also a small range of special icons, which appear every once in a while, and can either power-up the current weapon, add ground missiles or activate a shield around the ship. Finally, a smart bomb can be launched with the second action button and greatly damage everything on screen. Legion has an interesting level structure and different routes are provided at strategic points throughout the game. It is also the only shooter to play a narrative voice at the beginning of every stage, giving the game an unusual and authentic film noir touch.

After making this choice, the player gets to select the first opponent.  After every winning hand, the player is shown a strip sequence and is awarded a lemon which can be used to buy cheat items with.  Players may save up lemons in order to buy better items.  After winning five hands against the current opponent, the player advances to the next girl.  Game play continues until all strip sequences have been revealed or the player runs out of betting funds.

Licensed to Sega for Japan market.

Atari's first vector game. "Lunar Lander", was inspired by "Moonlander", a game written by Jack Burness in 1973 as a demo for the DEC GT40 vector graphics terminal (based on a PDP-11/05 CPU). This game used a light pen to control thrust and rotation.

If the player landed at exactly the right spot, a McDonalds appeared. The astronaut would leave the lander and walk over to the McDonalds and order a Big Mac to go, before walking back to the Lander and taking off again. If players crashed directly into the McDonalds, the game displayed a message reading 'You clod. You've destroyed the only McDonald's on the Moon.' After a short run of Lunar Lander machines were manufactured, production was shifted over to "Asteroids" and the first few hundred "Asteroids" machines were housed in Lunar Lander cabinets. Atari donated a gold edition version of the coin-operated video game to the Discovery Center of Science &amp; Technology in Syracuse, New York.

On 17 June 1980, Atari's "Asteroids" and "Lunar Lander" were the first two video games to ever be registered in the Copyright Office.

David Nelson holds the officially recognized world record for this game (certified via Twin Galaxies) with 1525 points. This was achieved using a single credit and 750 units of fuel which are the default settings for this game.

A Lunar Lander units appears in the 1984 movie 'The Philadelphia Experiment'.

		<name>Line of Fire / Bakudan Yarou (World, FD1094 317-0136) </name>
		<desc>Line of Fire is a lightgun controlled shoot-em-up for one or two players, in which two commandos find a special weapon - a vehicle mounted, automatic machine pistol - hidden deep within an enemy base. Before they can escape to report their findings, however, they find themselves surrounded by enemy forces and must blast their way through enemy lines and escape, using the enemies' own super weapon against them.

As well as enemy troops, players will have to contend with artillery, tanks and helicopters. At the end of each stage they will face a powerful boss vehicle that must be destroyed to progress. Between stages, a map screen is displayed which shows the players' progress through the terrorist facility and towards freedom.

Ammunition is limited to a few clips of bullets for the machine gun, a small supply of hand grenades and a screen clearing missile, although additional supplies can be obtained by shooting the relevant icons as they appear during play.

Settings ranging from enemy bases to thick jungle.

		<name>Lost Tomb (easy) </name>
		<desc>A shoot-em-up set in an ancient, South American pyramid, in which the player must explore a large number of single rooms in the search for treasure. Each room is filled with enemy creatures that must be killed or avoided. The player is equipped with a limited amount of whips and must collect as many items of treasure as possible.

The player is presented with options throughout the game, depending upon which rooms they wish to enter. Once a path is chosen, players must pick up treasures, kill all the monsters in their way, find the key and exit the room as fast as they can; avoiding the potential of setting off an earthquake. Upon exiting a level, the player is presented with a hallway which shows a number of doorways allowing access to any one of several different rooms. This allows players to pick their own route through the game, but the decision which room to tackle next must be taken quickly as players must reach their chosen room quickly or risk being attacked by a flock of screeching birds.

The player's character is armed with an eight-way firing gun (in a similar fashion to Williams' 1982 classic, "Robotron"). In addition to the gun, the player is also equipped with three whips, which can be used to either kill attacking creatures or to knock down any walls that bar the player's progress. Players are given the opportunity to purchase additional whips at the interludes between levels; this is done by inserting an extra credit into the arcade machine and pressing the relevant button.

Treasure must be constantly collected in order to stay alive.

		<name>Magician Lord (NGM-005) </name>
		<desc>Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.

Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game's 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.

Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special coloured orbs that ocassionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.

These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:

* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standad attack, can also be aimed diagonally.

* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades – blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.

* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.

* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.

* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.

* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.

		<name>Majestic Twelve - The Space Invaders Part IV (Japan) </name>
		<desc>The third sequel to Taito's seminal "Space Invaders", Majestic Twelve leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco's "Galaxian" - ensure that Majestic 12 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.

The original game's flying saucer still makes an appearance, but instead of merely awarding bonus points when shot - as in the original game - it now drops a power-up pod for the player to retrieve. Power-ups include shield, faster shots, a laser (activated with the second button) and a giant butterfly, which freezes the invaders for a limited time.

One of the game's most memorable features was the 'Cattle Mutilation' bonus screen, in which the player must protect a heard of cattle from a number of fast-moving saucers, intent on stealing the animals. If a cow is snatched; the player must shoot the relevant saucer to free it; being careful not to actually shoot the cow itself. The '91 incarnation also introduced 'bosses' to the series for the first time; giant, screen-filling aliens that required several shots to kill.

Another major difference to the previous games in the series is that if an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will simply lose a ship (in the original, the game would end once an alien had landed). Also, the player's ship now comes equipped with a shield that can withstand several hits. The shield's strength is depleted every time it takes a direct hit from one of the invaders, and too many hits will result in the shield disappearing altogether. A direct hit on an un-shielded ship will result in the loss of a player life.

		<desc>A mass prison breakout has occurred and the prison warden has been kidnapped in this sideways scrolling shoot-em-up from Konami. The player controls a lonely police officer whose job it is to kill the hordes of escaped convicts and, eventually, rescue the kidnapped warden. Each level also has a number of civilian hostages that also roam the levels and need to be rescued.

The player begins the game with only a pistol, but two extra weapons, in the form of a bazooka and a tear gas gun, can be collected. The 'Weapon Select' button cycles through the player's weapons via a display at the bottom of the screen. When the desired weapon is highlighted, pressing the Fire button will select and fire the desired weapon.

Hostages will randomly run across the screen and can be rescued by running into them. Should the player accidentally shoot a hostage, all extra weapons will be lost leaving only the pistol.

		<name>Mappy (Japan) </name>
		<desc>You are Mappy, the brave mouse policeman. Mappy's mission is to retrieve all of the stolen treasure from the Mewkies cat gang. They've stashed all of the loot in their leader's mansion which contains several floors, and numerous trampolines that the Mewkies like to use to travel between stories. Mappy must keep away from the cats and collect all items in the house before moving on to the next house. If Mappy is caught by a cat, he loses a life. Mappy also loses a life if he crashes to the floor by breaking through a trampoline or falling into a pitfall. When all of Mappy's lives are lost, the game is over. 

Houses have six floors, and some houses in later rounds have an attic. Mappy gets to the different floors by jumping on a trampoline. Mappy can jump three times on a trampoline, but the fourth time will break it. Once Mappy moves onto a floor, he can jump on the trampoline another three times. 

When Mappy jumps on the trampoline, he will go to the top floor of the house unless you push the joystick left or right to move him onto a particular floor. You can move Mappy onto a floor as he's on the way up, but not on the way down. 

Nyamco, the boss cat, does not chase Mappy. Instead he moves around in a zigzag pattern. He also like to hide for a few seconds behind a treasure. 

The cats are very sneaky and, if given half a chance, will try to corner Mappy at the end of one of the platforms or to trap him on one of the floors he must use to get to the treasures he's after. 

The cats have no defense mechanisms of any kind. But they cannot be permanently eliminated either. As soon as Mappy puts one cat out of commission, another cat appears somewhere else in the house. 

However, in an emergency, you can slow one cat down for short periods of time. This is accomplished by having Mappy throw open a standard door in the cat's face to knock him down and stun him. When hit by the door, the cat will be stunned for several seconds. When he is disabled like this, Mappy can walk right by him and not get caught. To temporarily eliminate more than one pursuer at a time, Mappy must catch them in the microwaves emitted when opening power doors - the thick flashing doors that flicker with different colors. 

As your skill level increases, the number and direction of pursuers coming at you at any one time and the speed with which they move, is gradually increased; plus, their pursuit patterns become more and more devious while their overall accuracy is highly improved. 

Bonus lives are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Extra Lives' dip switch). 

Once all the treasure in the house has been retrieved, you move on to the next house. 

A bonus round is awarded to you after the 2nd house, and after every 3rd house thereafter, i.e. in after the 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, etc. houses. In the bonus rounds, you score extra points by popping balloons. Using the trampoline, jump to pop as many balloons as possible in the fewest number of moves. The bonus round ends when the music ends. If you die during a bonus round, the bonus round ends there, but the number of lives remaining is not affected. 

- CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Mappy ("Micro Police") - This is you, our hero and defender of justice, the police-mouse who is on the case to recover the stolen loot from the enemy cats. 

Nyamco ("Boss The Big Bit") - Does not chase Mappy, but moves around the house in a zig-zag fashion 

Mewkies ("Naughty Folks") - This gang of smaller cats chases and tries to catch Mappy. 

Gosenzo - This appears when Mappy moves throughout the house for a long period of time without retrieving any stolen items. Once it appears, Mappy has no chance of escaping. 

Doors - When Mappy is directly in front of a door, press the Door button to open the door. Doors open in the direction of the doorknob. Mappy cannot go through a closed door; you must open it to go through. 

Power Doors - These flicker with different colors and are thicker than the ordinary doors. When you press the Door button, the door opens and sends a microwave that flushes away Mappy's feline pursuers. There are four power doors in each house.

Marble Madness was the first game to feature true stereo sound; it was the first game to truly capitalise on what in-game music could offer the player, with each level having its own distinctive, and suspense building soundtrack. Marble Madness was also one of the few games of the time to have a definite goal, in that the game ends when all levels are completed.

Stan Szczepanski holds the official record for this game with 187,880 points.

A sequel to this classic game, entitled "Marble Madness 2 - Marble Man" was fully developed and a very small number of cabinets were built, but unfortunately the game was never released. Unlike the first game's superb trackball control, 'Marble Man' was controlled via a joystick.

		<name>Mazer Blazer (set 1) </name>
		<desc>The object of the game is to prevent the attacking aliens from working through the maze and entering your ship. Each time an alien enters your ship, you lose a life.

There are 14 different types of aliens in Mazer Blazer. Each level will have 1 or 2 different types of aliens that present the player with constantly changing levels of difficulty. The screen is divided into 4 colors. The colors determine the point value of the object (see Scoring section for more details).

Shoot the aliens using the rapid fire Mazer Blaster. The farther from the ship you shoot the aliens, the higher the poin value awarded.

The walls of the maze are in 2 different colors; grey and orange. Orange walls are indestructible, while the grey walls can be shot away either by the nasties on the screen or your Mazer Blaster. Shooting the grey walls leaves gaps in the maze ans makes it easier for the aliens to reach their ship, and lowers your wall bonus.

After each level is a Timed Bonus Rack. There are 8 aliens per bonus rack.. Shoot the aliens as fast as possible for a maximum bonus. The aliens seen in the bonus rack will be the alien encountered in the next maze level.

In every maze is the freeze target (located at the lower center of the screen). The freeze target, when hit, momentarily stops the movement of the aliens on the screen.

		<name>Mazinger Z (World) </name>
		<desc>Mazinger Z is an action game based on the most influential Japanese animation series aired in the seventies featuring classic and colorful giant robots. Dr. Hell has decided to take over the world and his army of robots brings terror and destruction everywhere they go. The player takes controls of Mazinger Z, a powerful humanoid super-robot created by Dr. Kabuto and piloted by the young Koji. The game starts in a devastated city where the player quickly encounters the first legions of Dr Hell's giant robots. Mazinger Z has special weapons and abilities - like in the television series, he can use his fists to punch his opponents, but he can also use special attacks such as missiles, Eye-Photon Beams or the red wave-laser that he shoots from his chest. He can also launch his fists for long range attacks. But do not worry, they are well designed and automatically come back into place for future punch attacks. Enemies can also be grabbed and thrown away, or Mazinger Z can trigger special combo-attacks if he keeps punching them quick enough. The game features six levels and short animated cutscenes are played between each one of them as the story unfolds. Each stage is split in small areas where all enemies need to be destroyed before Mazinger can carry on his journey to the level's boss.

		<name>Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion (Japan 930713) </name>
		<desc>A 1-on-1 fighting game in which players choose from 10 different wrestlers and take to the ring to try and defeat their larger-than-life opponents. Each wrestler has an assortment of moves, including his own special 'super slam'. The object of the game is to win and defend the championship by pinning or putting a submission hold on your opponent.

There are 2 different game modes to select and play : Single Match or Tag Team 'Battle Royal'. In Single Match, players choose to be one of eight wrestlers including 'Mike Hagger', 'Alexander The Grater', 'El Stingray', 'King Rasta Mon', 'Titanic Tim', 'Gunloc', 'Biff Bolshevik' and 'The Great Oni' ('Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion' cannot be selected in this game).

Once a wrestler has been selected, players will compete in a world-wide tournament against the other 9 wrestlers (including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion') in respective matches. In each match, players must defeat each of their respective opponents by a pinfall, count-out or submission in order to proceed to each of the following matches. Once all opponents are defeated, the winner will be crowned champion and players will have to face all opponents again to defend their title.

In Tag Team 'Battle Royal', players can choose to play as any 2 of the 10 wrestlers for their tag team, including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion'. Here, the player and his or her partner have to eliminate both of the 2 wrestlers on the opposing tag team, in order to win the match and proceed to the next. During these matches, if the player is eliminated before his or her partner is, the match will be declared no contest and it will be a draw.

During each bout in this game, metal buckets and/or glass bottles will sometimes be thrown into the ring which can be picked by the players' wrestler(s) and used as weapons against their opponents.

Its operation ability is similar to Nintendo's PlayChoice-10, where the credits bought give the user a playable time period rather than lives (usually 1 minute per credit), and can switch between games during playtime.

The Mega-Tech also includes the ability to display to a second monitor, which contains a list of the games installed in the machine and also displays instructions for controlling the game, 1 or 2 player information, and a short synopsis of each game. The second monitor also displays the time left for playing.

		<desc>SINGLE PLAYER GAME

The game-play sequence in MEGATACK consists of 4 or 5 turns (operator selectable) each of which lasts as long as the player can skilfully maneuver his spacepod to avoid destruction. When he loses a spacepod, the GIP message reappears, accompanied by the GIP sound, and displays the number of spacepods left. After the last spacepod is destroyed, the game-over sound is heard and the game-over message is displayed.

Assuming a (4) pod game, play begins with player-scores (00000) and at the top and the (3) best scores displayed across the bottom Eight (8) monsters appear in the upper portion of the screen and move towards the bottom, while dropping their bombs. The player uses his joystick control to move his spacepod across the bottom of the screen. The spacepod will start with the number (4) in the center and the number will decrease each time a spacepod is destroyed so that the number (1) will be in the center on the last round.

As the spacepod is moved across the bottom of the screen the player fires his laser energy-beams towards the left, right, and straight-up accompanied by an echoing laser sound effect. The laser beams have unlimited range, covering the entire play-field, and each spacepod has an unlimited number of shots. The (3) laser beams are fired simultaneously. Each fire-button must be released and pressed again to fire a second shot. Also, there is a slight "reload" delay so that beams cannot-be fired too rapidly.

Whenever a laser beam strikes a monster or a bomb, it explodes with a visual flash and an audio blast. If a monster is blasted, the player is awarded a 'kill' and his score is increased by the appropriate score (per the scoring menu when a bomb is blasted, no points are scored.  

When a spacepod is hit by a bomb, it explodes with a growing flash and a reverberating blast. When the spacepod gets too close to a monster, the monster jumps up and sporadically devours it while growling and burping, if a monster reaches the bottom, it bounces across the bottom in an attempt to devour the spacepod.

When all the monsters in a given round have been destroyed the screen will turn into a starfield, and small space rings will appear, which if not shot at, hit, and destroyed will grow in size. If any one (1) ring is allowed to reach a predetermined size, it will de-activate the spacepods laser gun, which during these rounds only fires straight up, lift the spacepod off the bottom of the screen, absorb it and then disappear (shrinking in size), thus ending the round. The next round begins with the next wave of monsters. This starfield round occurs between every wave of monsters, and if the player is successful in destroying all the rings the next wave of monsters will then appear.

When the spacepod is finally destroyed either by being absorbed, hit by a bomb or devoured by a monster the round is over and the video image returns to the GIP display flashing player (1) up and displaying the remaining spacepods the screen then goes black again and this time the pod with the number (3) in the center appears at the bottom of the screen and play continues as before.

During play there are always (8) monsters (max) on the screen, however the monsters attack in waves of 25, after each multiple of 25 kills the starfield or space ring round will appear with each ring worth the same score as the monsters were worth in the previous screen display. The monsters that reappear after each space ring round are a new shape, and color and score more points, and drop a different color bomb, any monsters left at the end of a round will reappear at the beginning of the next round. At the beginning of the game the action is rather moderate to allow new players an opportunity to develop a 'feel' for the game. In each succeeding wave of monsters, the bombs begin to fall at an increased rate and the monsters motions are increased.

All of these features combine to make MEGATACK satisfying for the novice, challenging for the expert, and profitable for the operator.

TWO-PLAYER MODE

The play of MEGATACK in a two-player game is identical to single-play with the players alternating turns. On the Upright Version, the players use one common set of controls. On the cocktail version there are two sets of controls on opposite sides of the table. The computer activates control alternately between player 1 and 2 and flip-flops the screen image so that it is oriented to the player in control.

The GIP message, which appears after each turn, clearly indicates which player is up by flashing it in the player's color. This also allows time for the players to position themselves at the controls, but is brief enough to avoid unnecessary "dead-time". The use of two different player-colors eliminates any confusion as to which player is in control.

		<desc>Earth is under attack from an alien race from the 'Nemesis' region of space, and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as 'Newalones' - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth's scientists have developed the 'Black Fly' project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien aggressors.

Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of 'Newalone' molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship's firepower.

As long as the Metal Black ship has sufficient firepower, players can activate the 'Beam Weapon', which generates a powerful energy beam that destroys everything it comes into contact with. The Beam Weapon will only last for a few seconds and its use will reduce the ship's energy levels. Once the Beam weapon de-activates, Metal Black will have vastly reduced firepower for its forward-firing laser cannon. Players must once again collect the Newalone molecule clusters to build up the ship's firepower.

		<desc>Metal Clash is a futuristic fighter game for one or two players. In one player mode, the player pilots the metariod 'Saiber' to annihilate the alien robots.  

The player pilots his robot around the screen destroying enemy robots using punches and kicks. Flying saucers can be destroyed for a life energy boost.  Items in the background can be destroyed for points. After defeating a set number of enemies the stage's boss will appear. The boss is more powerful than regular enemies, and has his own life energy bar shown on screen. Some of these bosses can be disarmed of their powerful weapons (such as guns and energy shields) which the player can equip and carry on into further levels.

When hit by enemies, the player will lose energy and will drop any weapons that he has equipped. When the player's life energy is completely depleted he will lose a life. The game is over once all of the player's lives are lost.  The game features no continues.

The two player game is a vs. match between players. Gameplay continues until one player has lost all of his lives.

Progress is aided by springboards - which allow the player to jump over obstacles - and a skateboard, which is unaffected by the green tiles that otherwise slow the player's progress. Bonus points can be earned by kicking the static drinks cans that can be found throughout each level.

		<name>M.I.A. - Missing in Action (version S) </name>
		<desc>M.I.A. is a direct sequel to 1985's 'Green Beret' and, like it's predecessor, is a horizontally scrolling jump and shoot game for one or two players. Special forces soldiers must penetrate several enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound. 

Upon reaching the compound, the player must infiltrate and rescue the POWs held there, before escorting them safely through a final enemy-packed level to the rescue helicopter that awaits at the end. 

Unlike 'Green Beret', the two-player game in M.I.A. sees both players fighting side-by-side, instead of the alternate approach of the original game. 

The game consists of six stages; 

* War-torn battlefield 
* Airstrip 
* Jungle 
* Rail Yard 
* PoW Base 
* Escort the PoW's to the Helicopter 

The first four stages are presented in random order and may also be "mirrored", so players battle right-to-left instead of left-to-right. This vastly increases variety to the game and adds replay value. The PoW and helicopter stages are always the last two stages. At the end of each level, the players must fight off a flurry of enemy troops and destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. 

As with 'Green Beret', players start each level carrying only a combat knife. Specific enemy troops carry weapons which are dropped when the soldier is killed and can be picked up by the players. The weapons are always carried by soldiers wearing red uniforms, and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower or a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots. 

After rescuing the PoW's on the sixth stage, players must escort as many of the escapees as possible to a waiting helicopter, and must get at least one PoW safely aboard the chopper to complete the mission and start a new set of stages.

		<desc>One or two players take on the role of two commando brothers whose entire family has been kidnapped and must be rescued. The game's eight large, eight-way scrolling levels are made up of platforms, ledges and ladders; each populated both with enemy soldiers and with intricate, imaginatively designed enemy machinery.

In a gameplay mechanic first introduced in SNK's 'Ikari Warriors', players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to target and fire in all directions.

Some enemies, when killed, will drop a red key; collecting these keys allows players to upgrade their weapons at the shop that awaits at the end of each level. A maximum of six keys can be carried at any one time.

		<name>Minesweeper </name>
		<desc>This game was two player only, you must have a real live person to play against, or else the other players boat will head directly for the bottom wall, which doesn't make for a very interesting game. Each player moves their little boat around leaving a solid line of mines behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). One good strategy is to try and box your opponent in to a small section of the screen, and then just move carefully until they crash. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own mines, so avoid that at all cost.

The game was controlled with buttons rather than joysticks (this was cheaper to produce, and most of the other similar games of the time used buttons as well). Inserting a coin started the game at once. Both players got to play for a single coin. The game ended after one player chalked up six wins, but this was operator adjustable down to as low as three. The operator can also turn the sound on and off with internal switches as well.

		<name>Miss Bubble II </name>
		<desc>Miss Bubble II is an adult bootleg of "Bubble Bobble".  It features 100 single screen levels with photographic semi-nude images for backgrounds.  The background changes every three levels.

The player takes on the role of one of two yellow and green colored mice. Armed only with the ability to blow bubbles and jump, the objective is to trap and kill all of your enemies within the bubbles to advance to the next stage. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the mice reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. If a player is touched by an enemy then the player dies.

Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points.

On many levels, special bubbles appear such as water filled bubbles appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed.

Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to spell the word along the side of the screen.

Once the player loses all of his lives the game is over.  Upon continuing, all remaining enemies return to their un-angered forms.

		<desc>Mizubaku Daibouken is a colorful platform game by Taito, conversion of their own arcade game originally release in 1990. The protagonist of the game is a cute platypus named Hipopo on a mission to rescue his beloved girl friend and the rest of the platypus village from the claws of an evil fire demon. To help him in his task, our friend is given the power to throw water-bubbles to stun his enemies - once immobilized, Hipopo can kick them to oblivion for good. The power is however limited and our friend is condemned to wait to charge-up large bubbles. The player must guide our hero towards the Demon's hideout in order to free his friends - each zone is made out of several stages. Successfully completing a zone gets Hipopo to affront a boss but also allows him to choose his next route - later stages have several exists and secret warp doors which lead to different parts of the game's world. Finally, Hipopo can collect various special items such as speed-up, rapid-fire, large-bubbles, shield and so forth. Special food items can also be released by killing several enemies at once and blasting multiple combo-chains !

		<name>Mahjong Shikaku (Japan 880722) </name>
		<desc>Mahjong Shikaku is an adult mahjong game with a date theme. The objective of the game is to get through your date with your girlfriend with the end goal of reaching a hotel. Interfering with that goal are the various girls in the game, who each attempt to thwart your efforts by challenging your skills at strip mahjong.

At the start of the game, the player chooses a name and then his date begins.  At various date spots the player is stopped by one of five girls, who throws herself at the mercy of your mahjong skills. The player must defeat each girl before moving on in his date.

Throughout the course of the matches the player gains energy as shown by fire icons on the right hand side of the screen. When the player is 'fired up' he has better luck in the hands he is dealt so it is possible to make better winning hands. Even so, each girl has unlimited betting funds so the player must defeat each one three times, no matter how good of a hand the player has.

Each girl features two mandatory strip sequences, and the player gets to choose one of four options for the final strip sequence.

The player can lose a match and still continue right where he left off so long as he still has betting funds remaining.  But if his betting funds are depleted then the game is over.

		<name>Mortal Kombat II (rev L1.4) </name>
		<desc>Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. 

As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. 

Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. 

Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). 

Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.

		<name>Mortal Kombat (rev 1.0 08/09/92) </name>
		<desc>Mortal Kombat is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different fighters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. 

Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a round a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.

		<desc>In the 25th century, Mars is home to millions of immigrants. This is because Earth was going to be overcrowded, and thus the colonization of a terraformed Mars was the only solution. The problem is, at some point, an unknown source of energy, located in the south pole, is discovered by the local government. All of a sudden, a declaration of independence arrives on Earth. What's going on? The Earth fleet goes to reveal it, with the new 'Mosquito fighters' acting as intruders...

		<name>Munch Mobile (US) </name>
		<desc>A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.

The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive.

Various video-display phrase indicate score, time elapsed ('FUEL'), speed and which track was selected at the beginning of the game (eight different ones ranging from easy to hard). Players drive the grand prix car through the streets, while spectators observe from the side. Bales of hay, cola stands, trees, and bushes also line the roadway.

Four computer-controlled cars provide challenge : they pass the player's car at high speed and may cause it to skid or even crash. However, the computer cars are not unfailable and may also skid or crash occasionally. Realistic engine revving, screeching tires and crash sounds accompany game play.

		<desc>MONSTER BASH is a fascinating cartoon theme game featuring colorful graphics in three exciting scenes of hunt-and-hide adventure. Light-hearted, suspenseful music and audio sounds add to the fun, and heighten player interest and intrigue.

DRACULA'S HOUSE
The player-hero of the game is LITTLE RED, a wily, red-headed boy who chases Dracula throughout his five-story haunted house. Up and down staircases and through Warp Doors leading to secret passageways, Little Red zaps defending bats while attempting to light candles in certain rooms. When a candle is lit a Magic Sword is energized with mystical powers. Little Red must touch the flashing Magic Sword to gain SuperZap power... only a SuperZap will defeat the sly Dracula.

FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE
Little Red enters the eerie castle of the hulking Frankenstein. He pursues Frankenstein around his six-story castle while avoiding the fierce Wolfmen.  The tricky Wolfmen can be zapped, but be careful, they can duck under the zap and attack Little Red. Fewer candles are now available to be lit. Warp doors to secret passageways can be used only when they flash. Special jump-down zones allow Little Red to jump down several levels at once, eliminating any Wolfmen in the way as he descends, but Frankenstein can only be defeated with a SuperZap.

CHAMELEON MAN'S GRAVEYARD
The greatest challenge yet... to dispatch the sneaky Chameleon Man and his horde of Spiders.  Entering the spooky graveyard, Little Red finds that only one candle is available for lighting which is found in a crypt guarded by giant Spiders. Chameleon Man changes his color to match that of the background and thus becomes invisible. Little Red must pass over one of the Color-Change Spots to change the background color making Chameleon Man visible again. Chameleon Man can do away with Little Red with a flick of his long tongue. Chameleon Man can only be done in with a SuperZap.

		<name>Moon Cresta (bootleg set 2) </name>
		<desc>MOON CRESTA is a 1 or 2-player game in which players may compete for highest score against the game computer. Each time a player is hit by an alien, the game switches to his opponent's sequence.

The object is to destroy as many of the descending aliens as possible. To accomplish this the player is given a three stage multi-fire Warship. He begins with the first stage, firing a single laser at the enemy. If he is successful in eliminating the first 4 sets of aliens, he is given an opportunity to dock his first stage onto the second within a specific time limit (the sooner he unites the stages, the higher is his awarded score).

Once docked, the stages combine their firing power, so the first (1 laser) adds to the second (2 lasers) giving the player a total of 3 usable lasers as the game continues.

The player then must face 2 more sets of aliens and a shower of meteors, after which he has a chance to dock again, this time uniting with the third stage for a combined fire power of five lasers. If he is able to defeat the last two sets of aliens intact, the entire sequence begins again. The game continues with increasing difficulty until the entire warship is destroyed. When the warship is hit the player continues with whatever stages remain. If his score reaches 30,000 he is awarded a free game and his score continues to accumulate.

		<desc>A licensed sequel to the legendary "Space Invaders". Moon Base's gameplay is virtually identical to the original game, with the player once again moving a laser base back and forth along the bottom of the screen, shooting endless waves of aliens marching downwards towards the player. Once again flying saucers can be shot for extra points.

Some minor enhancements over the original include the wave number now being indicated on the player's laser bases, and the inclusion of the infamous 'color cellophane overlay', added to give the impression of coloured alien sprites.

The peace of the land has again been threatened, this time by 'Dark Guld', who was supposed to be imprisoned but apparently is not. He has instead now gotten his hands on the Golden Axe, and is using it for his own nasty purposes, and with his minions is causing much chaos.

So once more, Ax-Battler, the fierce barbarian; Tyris-Flare, the fearless Amazon; Gilius Thunderhead, the ferocious dwarf, rise up to deal with the oppression, with their might and magic, and recover the Golden Axe.

		<desc>Mighty! Pang is the fourth game in the superb Pang series. While the artistic design has been drastically changed, Mighty! Pang retains the same gameplay of its predecessors. The game features three modes of play: panic, tour and expert modes.

Tour mode is the standard mode of play featuring 57 stages. The player goes on a tour of the world, popping balloons and picking up power-ups. Each location on the tour features a number of stages which feature a new background of a famous tourist attraction. Each stage is cleared by popping all of the balloons within that stage.

Expert mode is a mode for advanced players.  Play is broken up into stages like in tour mode but the stages are much more difficult.

Panic mode is a basic one-stage mode of play where new balloons continuously fall from the sky. The single stage is a basic one with no platforms or barriers. Some of the smallest balloons will flash and shooting these balloons will pause all of the balloons in place for a short duration of time.

		<name>Mr. Do! (Taito) </name>
		<desc>Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.

Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.

Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.

After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.

A level can be completed any one of several different ways : either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).

		<name>Mr. Do! (bugfixed) </name>
		<desc>Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.

Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.

Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.

After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown.

		<name>Mr. HELI no Daibouken </name>
		<desc>Mr Heli no Daib?ken is the conversion of Irem's shooter originally released in the arcades in 1987. It features a cute little orange helicopter with tiny feet. Thanks to these, Mr Heli can fly around the screen and also walk on the ground. All of this plays an important role in the game's mechanics - He can shoot straight in front of him (either left or right), or shoot missiles above him. However, when on the ground, the same action button instead drops bombs. The power-up system is very unusual and unique - blocks are scattered around every stage and they hide blue crystals, and the bigger they are, the more money they're worth. Special items (including a better gun, missiles, smart-bombs and energy tanks) are also hidden under these blocks and can be purchased in exchange of the precious crystals. Each level is split into three areas - first the main zone with a smaller boss awaiting at the end of it, then the player enters a sub-stage plunged in the dark where only his gun can get him to see what is ahead of him. The only way to get the light back is to destroy the nearby generator and rush all the way to the exit... to the boss' lair. Defeat him to complete the area and fly to the next stage !

		<name>Ms. Pacman Champion Edition / Zola-Puc Gal </name>
		<desc>Basically this game is "Pac-Man", with a few minor differences. The major difference is that the ghosts have fewer restrictions on their movement, making them more formidable. Also adding to the challenge are the different mazes and the fact that the fruit no longer stays in one place, but moves in, out and around the maze. Fortunately there is a power pellet in each corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

Ms. Pac-Man Championship Edition has a timer added which gives you one minute to finish the maze with your Character. As the timer works through the last five seconds Ms. Pac-man slows down considerably.

		<name>Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II (NGM-2410)(NGH-2410) </name>
		<desc>The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri.

Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.

		<name>Metal Slug 3 (NGM-2560) </name>
		<desc>The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.

Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect : should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.

		<name>Ms. Pac-Man </name>
		<desc>In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. 

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. 

Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. 

Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds : 

The first maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze two times before moving on to the next maze. 

The second maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze three times before moving on to the next maze. 

The third maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only one set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

The fourth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. 

After Round 13, the game alternates every four rounds between the third and fourth mazes. 

Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different from those of the original game. 

As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present : 

1) Act I - They Meet : Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky while Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the two of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2. 

2) Act II - The Chase : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5. 

3) Act III - Junior : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to "Jr. Pac-Man". 

No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

The result is a better game and one of the finest chapters in this series.

		<desc>Basically this game is "Pac-Man", with a few minor differences. The major difference is that the ghosts have fewer restrictions on their movement, making them more formidable. Also adding to the challenge are the different mazes and the fact that the fruit no longer stays in one place, but moves in, out and around the maze. Fortunately there is a power pellet in each corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

The main difference being the order of levels has been changed. As in the regular "Ms. Pac-Man" game, the maze turns invisible at a certain point. However, in Ms. Pac Attacks, this point is reached much earlier - at about the 144th screen instead of the 255th.

		<desc>The land has been cast in darkness by Drokmar, who has been corrupted by the Black Orb; an artefact that promises immortality to anyone who comes under the influence of the orb's powerful sorcery. Two warriors set out to fight their way through fifty levels of platform beat-em-up, in order to destroy the orb - which lies at the top of the Dragon Tower - and free their lands.

Treasure chests litter the levels which, when smashed open, release treasure items, magic power-ups, keys, food and weapons. As players fight their way through the levels, they will come across a number of trapped prisoners. As long as the heroes are carrying keys, prisoners can be released who will then fight alongside the players, with each prisoner possessing their own unique attacks. Weapons and power-ups can be picked up to aid players in their quest and food can be found and eaten to increase player health.

As the players ascend the tower, they will be granted new magical weapons after each boss they defeat. The player's weapons are affected by a 'magic bar' that charges over time. When fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by pressing the Attack and Jump buttons at once, but costs health.

There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.

		<desc>Not long after the malign reign of the Death Adder has ended, another evil rises. The peace of the land has again been threatened, this time by 'Dark Guld', who was supposed to be imprisoned but apparently is not.

So once more, Ax-Battler, the fierce barbarian; Tyris-Flare, the fearless Amazon; Gilius Thunderhead, the ferocious dwarf, rise up to deal with the oppression, with their might and magic, and recover the Golden Axe.

		<name>Mello Yello Q*bert </name>
		<desc>The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each Level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each Level. Each level consists of four Rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).

The game play starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping on the rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two Rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top level and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To destroy Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.

Starting at the 3rd Round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third Round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right sides of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left sides of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third Round and every Round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.

During the 4th Round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second level from the top and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*Bert. Hopping Q*Bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.

Throughout the remaining Rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.

To add variety to the game, the disks will change positions every Round, and in the higher Levels the number of disks will change.

During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This mean: that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the destination color, completing the Round.

Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining Rounds, and Levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination color, but if Q*Bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination color, it will change again.

Here is a rundown of how all the colors change :

Legend :
S - Starting Color
I - Intermediate Color
D - Destination color

LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : During the 4th round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).

LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.

LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.

There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5000 points at Level 5.

		<desc>Mystic Warriors is a horizontally-scrolling platform beat-em-up for up to four players, in which the evil 'SKULL' organisation has taken over the world and driven its terrified civilians into hiding. Five Ninja warriors set about destroying SKULL and freeing the World from its grip.

Mystic Warriors features five selectable characters, one of which is shown being kidnapped by SKULL once players have made their character choices. What follows is eight levels of platform 'run-and-gun' action, with an end-of-level boss waiting at the end of each stage.

Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the "Shinobi Shield") which lasts a few seconds and a "Smart Bomb" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies. Some boxes also contain points-giving items, such as bags of money, jewellery and gold.

		<desc>One or two players take control of 2 machine-gun carrying Vietnam vets who must shoot their way through a number of sideways scrolling, Vietnam-themed levels. the players shoot into the screen and aiming is achieved via the use an on-screen target, which each player directs to lock on to the various enemy troops and vehicles. Players can run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire.

A number of more powerful weapons - such as grenades and flame throwers - are often dropped by the enemy and can be picked up and used. Bonus points are also revealed in this fashion.

Nam-1975 is a blatant plagiarism of TAD Corp's "Cabal", released in September 1988. Cabal is easily the more accomplished of the two games.

* K.R.A.K. Street 
* The Bridge 
* Sunset Strip 
* Skyhigh's Nursery

On this fun game the player controls a naughty boy who goes through the forest and must defend himself throwing rocks at monsters to destroy them. The longer you hold down the fire button, the farther your character can throw rocks. The boy must avoid a variety of monsters and obstacles while attempting to make it to the top of each level and proceed on to the next. There are a number of flags at the top of each level on a fortress that must be destroyed in order to proceed to next level.

Occasionally, there is a bonus round where your character fly back and forth at the top of the screen in a hot-air balloon in an attempt to drop rocks down upon a big monster that is running at the bottom of the screen to hit directly over his head. There is a fuel gauge that determines when the bonus round will end.

		<name>NBA Jam (rev 2.00 02/10/93) </name>
		<desc>2.00 USD. Nonetheless, the game was a smash hit.

NBA Jam was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games (It was the first game to be officially licensed by the NBA (National Basketball Association)), and was also one of the first sports games to feature real teams, real players, and their real digitized likenesses. However, the unrealism of the game was the major drawing point, as the high flying dunks (often featuring players jumping twice their own height in the air while making highly acrobatic slams) were the games' signature. Of course, seeing NBA superstars like Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal flying through the air with the greatest of ease brought just as many fans back. In time, players discovered another major feature of the game, as it was filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations.

		<name>Nebulas Ray (World, NR2) </name>
		<desc>NebulasRay is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up for one or two players. Civil war has broken out in the Austral star system, with the militaristic 'Master Forces' ousting the ruling government and looking to seize control of the entire system. 

Taking on the role of resistance fighters, players must battle through waves of enemy ships across 6 levels, before finally reaching and destroying the 'Master Fortress'. As well as forward-firing weapons, each player ship also carries a limited number of powerful bombs that inflict much greater damage on the enemy than the standard weapons. Initially, each player ship is armed with only 3 bombs. 

Numerous weapons and power-ups can be picked up during play, each of which can itself be powered-up: 
* WIDE SHOT - Increases shot width. 5 levels available. 
* GAIN POWER - Increases destructive power. 5 levels available. 
* SPEED UP - Increases player ship speed. 5 levels available. 
* BOMB - Extra bomb. Maximum of 7 can be carried. 
* FOUR-BARREL PHOTON - Powerful Photon torpedoes. Time-based. 
* HOMING LASER - Powerful lasers that automatically target enemies. Time-based. 
* LIGHTING BURST - Powerful short-range lightning burst. Time-based. 
* DEFLECTOR - Shield to protect player ships. Time-based. 
* EXTRA POINTS - Pick up for 3000 points. 

Visually, NebulasRay employs complex sprite rotation and scaling techniques - as well as multi-layered parallax scrolling - to create impressive and highly detailed graphics with a true sense of depth.

Nemo finds himself unable to find the Princess however, so he and 'Flip', a strange companion who also turns up in the dream, decide to explore Slumberland and find the king.

Nemo is a colourful and abstract platform shoot-em-up set in the dream world of Slumberland, a surreal world in which childrens' toys are running amok and must be destroyed. Nemo is armed with a magical staff that emits a burst of magic to destroy the many enemies, some of which require multiple hits. A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages.

		<name>Ninja Clowns (08/27/91) </name>
		<desc>A strange and hugely abstract beat-em-up for one or two players, in which circus clowns take to the streets to beat up other circus performers; as well as lawyers, maintenance workers, and other assorted professionals.

In addition to the standard beat-em-up kick and punch moves, the clowns can use their 'clown equipment' against their enemies; using items such as spring-loaded boxing gloves, bottles of soda water and, of course, cream pies.

		<name>Night Driver </name>
		<desc>You're in the drivers seat and the track is just ahead of you on the television screen. Your car is permanently fixed at the bottom of the screen, as shown in the diagram. All you have to do is accelerate and steer the car through one of the four tracks. Each time you veer off the track and hit one of the pylons or hit an oncoming car, a simulated crash scene will appear on the screen.

Game variations:
GANES 1, 2, 3 and 4 are timed. At the beginning of each of these games, a "clock" will begin counting down from 90 (seconds) at the upper right corner of the screen.

GAMES 5, 6, 7, and 8 have no time limit. They may be played for an indefinite period of time and there will not be a clock counting down on the screen.

GAMES 1 and 5 have the easiest track (NOVICE) and should be used by beginning players. Games 2 and 6 have the medium difficulty track (PRO). The EXPERT track in GANES 3 and 7 is more difficult than the NOVICE or PRO tracks.

All of the tracks described so far (GANES 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7) are stored in the program memory of the game. So even though the NOVICE, PRO and EXPERT tracks are progressively more difficult, each track will always follow a fixed course. This makes it possible for players to eventually memorize the track as their driving skill increases.

The RANDOM track, however (GANES 4 and 8), follows a different course each time, making it challenging for the most skilled players.

		<name>Super Mario World (Nintendo Super System) </name>
		<desc>Just when you thought that Bowser and his Koopalings have already learned their lesson about messing with the Mario Brothers, they are already at it again. The only difference is that Bowser is currently wreaking havoc in the Dinosaur World. Now it's up to Mario and Luigi to rescue Princess Toadstool, save Dinosaur World and hopefully put Bowser and his Koopalings in their place.

The gameplay action is sidescrolling as in previous Mario games and it takes advantage of the SNES's 16-bit graphics and stereo audio. The game consists of a journey through levels in seven worlds: Yoshi's Island, Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Twin Bridges Area, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, and the Valley of Bowser. There are also two secret worlds--Star World and Special World (accessed via the Star World)--which can be found by completing secondary goals in specific levels.

SMW contains a map screen on which the player moves, expanding this concept which was introduced in "Super Mario Bros. 3". It features 72 courses laid out across the seven worlds, and 96 exits (some levels have more than one exit). Secret exits open up new routes on the overworld map, often leading to secret levels. If you get all 96 exits you can play in a slightly different world.

The Yoshis appear in 4 different colors (green, yellow, red, and blue), each with slightly different abilities. There are also Baby Yoshis in the Star World levels which can be picked up by Mario. After eating five enemies, three berries, a Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, Starman, or Cape Feather, they will become a fully grown Yoshi of the same color.

		<name>Numan Athletics (World) </name>
		<desc>An athletics game featuring 8 tournaments :

Interceptor
A real life missile defense style-contest as missiles are being launched from a ship, and you must use your mystical powers to stop the oncoming missiles. The outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) make you step to the left or right, and the middle button is fire. Failure to hit the missile results in you being blown up. If you select Sharon from France, most of her clothes would disappear except for the bottom part of her suit.

Niagara Jumps
The final competition in the tournament. It is also considered to be the most difficult competition in the game. Very similar to the Triple Jump competition in the Olympics. The object is this contest is to make it across the falls. Alternately press buttons 1 and 3 to build up speed, then press button 2 three times. If you don't time yourself properly, you will sink and drown and you will go down the steep falls.

Nonstop Rock Chop
You must smash as many rocks as you can before time runs out. Rapidly press buttons 1 and 3 alternately until the gauge is full, then press button 2 to smash the rock.

Numan Sniper
In this contest, monsters will jump out of the sea from three different locations. Your object, destroy them. Press buttons 1, 2 or 3 varying by their location to shoot.

Scud Toss
Just as in the Javelin competition in the Olympics. Played on a "Track and Field"-like field with an only exception -- a missile. Rapidly and continuously press the two run buttons and then push and hold the middle button to set the angle of which you would throw the missile. Again, like Interceptor, if you select Sharon -- then again if she is faulted, she will be missing most of her clothes.

Tower Topper
Here you are expected to climb up to the building rooftop with the fastest time possible. Press button 2 repeatedly to scale the side of a building. If you press it too early -- you won't move, but if you press it too late -- you will fall off.

Turbo Dash
Much like the 100m Dash in the Olympics -- only the core elements have slightly changed. You are racing against a drag racer and another player. Press the two outside buttons (1 &amp; 3) in alternate fashion until your RSI (or 'special speed') sets in.

VS. Express
Very similar to a familiar scene in the Superman comic books. You must stop the oncoming train using your magical powers and send it in the opposite direction backwards. Press button 2 to stop the train, then hammer the outside buttons to build up power before bunging it back down the track. If you don't time this right -- the train will run you over.

		<desc>When playing this game, you are the pilot of an Omegan Space Fighter in training to defend Omega's Star Colonies. You are stationed in space to destroy as many waves of attacking enemy droid ships as possible.

You begin your training with a small number of droid ships in the first wave of attackers and gradually build your skill until there is a maximum number of 12 attacking droid ships per wave. These attaching ships not only move independently and fire at you, they also drop two different kinds of space mines to block your path and your shots at them.

As your skill level increases, the speed with which the droid ships attack is gradually increased and their shots at you become more accurate.

Bonus ships are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each enemy ship and mine has a point value.

The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while destroying as many attacking droid ships and space mines as you can. As you do this, each following wave of attackers will be harder to destroy.

		<name>Operation Wolf (World, set 1) </name>
		<desc>Back in 1987, Taito's original game hit arcades like a storm. In the game, players take control of a single armed soldier who's mission in life is to infiltrate the heavily defended enemy territories and rescue as many Prisoners Of War, or POWs, as possible. Unlike many shooter back then, Operation Wolf offers a subjective view of the scene. This feature does not sound like much nowadays, but back in 1987, First Person Shooters (known today as FPS) were far from being the norm. The scenery is shown through the eyes of our valiant soldier and the screen automatically side-scrolls while hundred of enemy soldiers throw anything they have at him. In order to protect his life, he is equipped with a Uzi gun and a grenade launcher with a limited stock of ammo. And watch out ! Not everything on screen must be shot, and characters like nurses or children will dramatically lower your life. Bonuses are of course available, sometimes just laying on the ground and sometimes hidden inside small running animals (do no ask me why) or coconuts. The most common items are ammo, but our soldier will also find rockets, drinks and special items like the ammo-unlimited free gun or the dynamite which will vaporize every single enemy on the screen. Finally, a two simultaneous player mode is available.

		<name>Outfoxies (World, OU2) </name>
		<desc>A platform 'versus' shoot'em up in which either one player (playing against the computer) or two players (playing against each other) attempt to destroy each other by any means necessary. The levels themselves are interesting and varied, with airships, planes etc. providing a detailed and highly interactive backdrop in which the players do battle. That interactivity is increased further with the introduction of destructible sections which, when blown up, can often open up new areas or rooms. Each level is littered with a variety of weapons that can be picked up and utilized by the player(s). Graphically, Outfoxies employed superb sprite scale and rotation techniques that elevated the already fun gameplay still further. The aeroplane level, for instance, dips and sways, bringing problems of inertia and gravity to the platform action. Also; the in-game camera zooms in and out of the level, depending on how far away the two opponents are from each other. Playable characters range from a monkey to a pair of psychotic school children, with each character choice offering the player different aptitudes (the monkey can jump higher, for example). A fun enough game in one-player mode, Outfoxies really came into its own when two human protagonists took part.

		<name>Ozma Wars (set 1) </name>
		<desc>A great and pioneer fixed vertical space shoot'em up game. 

The Ozma wars has begun, and the player controls a spacecraft which must fend off UFOs, spaceships meteors, and comets in a varied of space levels. Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly diminishing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily and a large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and dock with the player's spacecraft, allowing the energy to be refilled. There are 3-4 recognizable stages as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear. After these, the mothership will appear, and the cycle starts over; this continues indefinitely until the energy reaches zero.

		<name>P-47 - The Phantom Fighter (World) </name>
		<desc>P-47 is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.

The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air. Regardless of which part you are on, you will still have to deal with the same basic things. After part two of mission four, the missions will repeat again with mission one.

		<name>Pac-Gal </name>
		<desc>Basically this game is "Pac-Man", with a few minor differences. The major difference is that the ghosts have fewer restrictions on their movement, making them more formidable. Also adding to the challenge are the different mazes and the fact that the fruit no longer stays in one place, but moves in, out and around the maze. Fortunately there is a power pellet in each corner that (usually) turns the ghosts blue for a period of time, allowing you to eat them for points.

This is "Ms. Pac-Man" with a color change and a new name. Also, the Midway name has been removed although the Midway logo is still there.

		<desc>The second sequel to the superb 1989 original, Pang! 3 retains the same gameplay of its predecessors but adds vastly improved graphics and a choice of three difficulty levels; Beginner, Normal and Panic. On both the 'Normal' and 'Panic' skill levels, players can choose from 4 different playable characters; each possessing different strengths and weaknesses, such as a double harpoon or quick shots. On the beginner level, players can only use the Mexican character.

Another notable difference is in the game's use of backdrops : instead of the world landmarks of the first two games, Pang! 3 features classical works of art in the form of paintings and sculptures.

		<desc>One or two players control safari-suited characters armed with harpoon guns, who must destroy the numerous different-sized balloons that litter each stage. When hit by a harpoon, the balloons break down into smaller fragments, in a similar fashion to Atari's 1979 classic, "Asteroids".

Players can only fire the harpoon guns virtually upwards, but can move left and right, as well as climbing the ladders that appear on many of the levels. Each of the game's fifty levels is played against a backdrop of one of seventeen famous world landmarks. All balloons must be destroyed before players can advance to the next screen.

The game's levels each contain a different layout of blocks. While most of these are permanent fixtures, some disappear when shot, while others reveal hidden bonuses. Food item bonuses occasionally appear that can be collected for bonus points.

Player start each stage armed with only a single-shot harpoon, but some balloons, when popped, release special weapons that drop down to the bottom of the screen. Players then have a few seconds to collect the power-up before it disappears. Available power-ups are:
* A twin harpoon that allows two shots at once.
* A grappling hook that will stay attached to the ceiling or block for a short period of time.
* A rapid-fire gun. 

Other non-weapon bonuses include:
* A force field.
* An hour-glass that slows the balloons' movement.
* A clock that freezes the balloons for a short time.
* An extra life.
* Dynamite, that will pop all remaining balloons down to their smallest size.

		<name>Print Club (Japan Vol.1) </name>
		<desc>Print Club is a small photo booth found at video game arcades in Japan. The Print Club machines produce these small photo stickers (about 2.5 x 2 cm, slightly smaller than a postage stamp) which feature a large variety of superimposed frames which compliment the subject's faces. You just pay 300 yen, stand in front of a video monitor which shows your face, choose the desired frame, pose for the photo, then wait for a sheet of 16 photo stickers which the machine spits out in about a minute. The image quality is not so high (this is probably part of the charm), but the sticker is so small that it really doesn't matter. People affix the stickers on personal articles like notebooks, cell phones, etc. But mainly, school girls collect them to show friends.

		<name>Penguin Brothers (Japan) </name>
		<desc>A multi-screen platform game in which one or two players (either co-operatively or competitively) control a cute penguin fighting against the game's equally cute enemies. The idea is to destroy all of the on-screen enemies; once this a done, a circular key will appear; the player must pick the key up, whereupon they will be teleported to another screen which represents the second part of the stage. This screen has a silver doorway; the player must carry the key to the door - avoiding or destroying the on-screen enemies - to complete the level.

Playing as a loose cross between Taito's "Bubble Bobble" and Irem's "Bomber Man", each player's penguin is armed with bombs which are used to destroy the game's enemies, as well as obstructions - such as walls etc. - and barrels; the latter often revealing hidden bonuses that can be collected. Players must be careful to avoid blowing themselves and each other up when the bombs detonate.

Each level contains one or more 'rotating' platforms, allowing travel between upper and lower platforms. Players and enemies can stick to the underside of a rotating platform, then rotate it through 180 degrees to reach the platform above them. The opposite applies to reach a lower platform.

		<desc>Pengo the Penguin is the eponymous star of Pengo the video game. The basic layout of Pengo is akin to that of Namco's legendary "Pac-Man"; featuring, as it does, a top down, single screen, maze-like arrangement. Pengo's enemies, the Sno-Bees, are also similar to Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde - the ghosts that pursued Pac-Man; not least because Sno-Bees also come in four different varieties, each represented by a different color.

One aspect that distinguishes Pengo from the Namco classic is that the Maze itself is a wholly interactive environment. Each section of wall is represented as a block of ice, which can be pushed onto the Sno-Bees to destroy them. The Sno-Bees themselves will destroy the ice blocks as they move around each level, so speed is of the essence. Some of the blocks are 'Diamond blocks' which cannot be destroyed, and can be re-used by Pengo.

The outer wall of each level can also be utilized; if the player pushes against the wall when a Sno-Bee is next to it, the Sno-Bee will be temporarily stunned, allowing Pengo to move in for the kill.

		<desc>As Pengo the Penguin, you race around the ice field rearranging huge blocks of ice. Your objectives: Destroy your opponents, the Sno-Bees, before they sting you; and line up three diamond blocks for a fortune in bonus points.

Use your joystick controller to move Pengo around the ice field. Press the lower fire button to kick an ice block accross the playfield or to crush an ice block that is trapped against the wall or against another block.

Squash the Sno-Bees by pushing ice blocks into them or by running Pengo over them when they are frozen. Line up the three diamond blocks by crumbling and kicking strategic ice blocks around the field until all three diamond blocks adjoin.

Each round is completed when you destroy all the Sno-Bees or when the last one escapes. The game ends when you lose your last Pengo life.

		<desc>Peter Pack Rat is a platform game in which the player, controlling the game's hero, a rat called Peter; must rush around a platform-filled screen collecting a variety of objects to take back to Peter's nest. These objects include bottles, watches, hats, balls, and cans.

A number of enemy creatures hinder the player's progress; these include rats, cats, dogs, bats and owls. There are 3 different levels to play through; a junkyard, a sewer and a tree.

As well as the objects that must be collected and taken to Peter's nest, additional objects can also be collected and thrown to stun attacking animals. Flying animals that have been stunned can be ridden around the screen for a short period of time. A round ends when all the desired objects have been collected and placed in the nest. Successive rounds add more objects and enemies, as well as changing the patterns of the shortcuts.

		<name>Pocket Fighter (Japan 970904) </name>
		<desc>A superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary "Street Fighter" series, as well as "Darkstalkers" and the little-known "Red Earth".

During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.

The 3 sub-bars show the level of 3 of each player's special moves. Each character has at least three special moves, as shown in the sub-bars, and each of these corresponds to a color. Some characters have one or two additional Special Moves that aren't affected by sub-bars. Each time a player shoots their opponent, gems pop out of him or her, and the attacker can take them to power up their own special moves according to the colors.

There are 4 buttons : PUNCH, KICK, SPECIAL, and TAUNT. The Special button is a chargeable move that cannot be blocked and upon impact drops gems in the opponent's possession. More gems will be dropped depending on how much the player charges the attack. Holding Down, Forward or no direction at all when using the Special button will cause a specific gem color to drop from the enemy. Holding Back along with the Special button allows for a defense that is specific against the unblockable Special attacks. Other kinds of attacks do no damage when blocked, and unlike most 2-D fighting games, this includes special and super moves.

Pocket Fighter also features Flash Combos in which a player can execute a combo by pressing the KICK or PUNCH button after they have hit their opponent using the PUNCH button for a total of 4 hits. Flash Combos will usually cause a player's fighter (except Ryu) to change into various costumes during the sequence, and perform a powerful attack in the end. This final hit is usually the hardest in the sequence to connect with. These costumes range from uniforms (such as traffic cops or schoolgirls), to swimsuits, and even cameos of other Capcom characters. For example, Chun-Li may turn into Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil series, while Felicia may turn into Mega Man or other Darkstalkers characters not playable in the game.

The commands are also very easy compared to the Street Fighter series, thanks to SPECIAL button. By doing a motion (for example : qcf or hcf) and pressing the Special Button the fighter will launch his or her super combo.

In addition to the usual punches, kicks and fireballs, each character has a couple of very abstract yet powerful 'special' attacks; which can range from the player producing a huge mallet (Ken), to standing on a podium and motioning a bicycle race through the opposing fighter (Chun Li).

		<name>Phoenix (Amstar) </name>
		<desc>In ancient times, legend says, there was a bird of great beauty. About the size of an eagle, it had brilliant scarlet and gold feathers, a melodious song, and was the only one of its kind in the entire world.

This fabulous creature lived in Arabia and had a life span of over five hundred years. At the end of its life, the phoenix built a nest of frankincense, myrrh, and other aromatic spices. After setting fire to the nest by rapidly beating its wings, the beautiful bird settled down to die amidst the flames.

From the ashes of that fire miraculously arose a young, revitalized Phoenix. This new bird then took the remains of its parent to the temple of the sun at Heliopolis in Egypt, and sacrificed them on the high altar.

The long life of the Phoenix and the dramatic rebirth from its own ashes has made this legendary bird a symbol of immortality and spiritual rebirth in many cultures. The Egyptians saw the myth as a symbol of the life cycle of the sun, which dies every day at sunset and is reborn every morning at dawn.  Most others interpret the legend as a general symbol for the regeneration of life after death.

However, something awful has happened to tarnish the long-standing image of the Phoenix. Due to the effects of radioactive fallout on its nest, the Phoenix has unfortunately mutated into a bird of prey.

Now, several birds arise from the ashes, but these are not like the beautiful, friendly bird of old.  These birds are mean. Their cries areshrill. They have developed a tough, metallic-like skin that makes them almost indestructible. And they have turned their backs on the human race to offer their services to alien beings determined to drain away earth's energy resources.

Your mission: Eliminate these seemingly immortal war hawks, destroy the alien spaceship, and safeguard our planet from ravaging energy-thieves.

You have five lives in which to survive the bombing attacks of four separate flocks of Phoenix war birds who protect the alien spaceship. Your challenge is to eliminate the birds, get to the spaceship that follows the fourth wave of birds, and shoot the alien pilot.

To eliminate the large, menacing Phoenixes of the third and fourth waves, you have to hit them in the center. If you only wing a Phoenix, like its ancient ancestor, it will soon regenerate the missing part and become a whole bird to attack you some more.

To destroy the alien pilot, you have to erode the multi-colored hull of the spaceship directly beneath the cockpit to create a clear shot at him. But one of the hull layers - the blue layer - rotates the length of the spaceship. So, you not only have to chip away at the blue  layer, but you also have to time your shot at the alien to coincide with the hole passing directly under him.

		<desc>Phozon is an unusual puzzle/arcade hybrid in which the player controls a black molecule with four red spikes. The idea is for the player to align other floating molecules onto their own molecule to create an increasingly complex pattern; this must match the "blue print" molecule that is situated in the middle of the screen. To make molecules adhere to the player's molecule, the player simply touches the target molecule with their own. If a molecule attaches in a place that does not fit the pattern shown in the middle of the screen, the player must press the reject button to make if float away. Groups of multi-coloured rotating spheres move around the screen and must be avoided.

		<desc>Pipi &amp; Bibis is a platform game for one or two players, in which the aim is to infiltrate buildings and plant time bombs at the computer terminals that litter the levels. The planting of the final bomb starts the detonation sequence, players must then quickly reach the level's exit before the bombs explode.

Each level is populated with enemy scientists and agents, and any contact with these will result in the loss of a life. To help combat this, players are armed with a 'stun gun' which will knock the enemy to the floor, allowing the player to pass. If an enemy is held in the stun gun's beam for several seconds, the enemy will fall to the platform below.

At the completion of each level, part of a cartoon picture of woman in a state of undress is shown. The entire picture is revealed once every four levels.

* An opening musical theme is used in certain parts of the game instead of the opening Tarzan yell (unlike in "Jungle Hunt", it is NOT the same one used at the end of the ocean stage). 
* The player character is a heroic pirate instead of the Tarzan character.
* In the first stage, the player swings on ropes between ship's masts instead of vines between trees.
* The second stage is set in an ocean infested with sharks, instead of a river infested with alligators and crocodiles. 
* The third stage adds a new enemy - snakes. They appear at the top of the screen and will kill the player if he touches them while jumping. 
* The enemies in the fourth stage are sword-wielding pirates instead of spear-chucking cannibals.

		<desc>Pleiads is a 2-D, space shooter style game. With its many interesting visual and audio effects, this game is sure to challenge the most avid player.

Each round of play includes 4 different stages. With the onset of the melodious background tune, the first stage of play begins.

Against a backdrop of planets and twinkling stars, the Earth City must be protected from sixteen attacking Martians. These Martian attackers have the ability to transform from flying Martians, to walking Martians, or to UFOs. The walking Martians build barriers across the Earth City. These barriers must be destroyed.

The Earth Spaceship can be maneuvered right and left. With the use of the 'warp' button, it can be randomly relocated when necessary. These, plus a backup of stationary defense weapons, aid in protecting the Earth City and Spaceship, as well as in destroying the Martian Attackers. When all but the two final Martians have been destroyed, a tone of dusk shades the Earth City. As these two attackers meet their end, the Earth Spaceship ascends into space to meet the challenge of Stage II.

In this second stage of play, the Earth Spaceship encounters eight Space Monsters. To destroy these Monsters, they must be hit in the direct center. When a Space Monster with burning wings is destroyed, up to 400 points can be added to your score. When all the Space Monsters have been destroyed, the Earth Spaceship prepares for Stage III.

In this third stage of play, the Earth Spaceship is confronted with the Martian Space Battleship and its unseen forces. This Martian Battleship contains five closed chambers, each protected by a rocket flame. Each chamber opens periodically at random, to release a defending reserve of Martian attackers. When a flame below an open chamber is extinguished, point value of the Martian Space Battleship increases. This enemy ship can be destroyed by either eliminating all sixteen Martian attackers, or by extinguishing all five rocket flames. When the Martian Space Battleship finally explodes, the Earth Spaceship moves on to Stage IV.

This last stage of play begins with an emergency signal, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. The Earth Spaceship is now ready to be guided on its journey, through a landing corridor, back to its home base. The Earth Spaceship must be carefully maneuvered around other spaceships in order to avoid destruction. Clearing flags will add bonus points to your score. When the Earth Spaceship has been safely maneuvered to its arrival target, 500 to 4,000 points will be added to your score, while bursts of fireworks greet your arrival and signal the beginning of a new round of play.

		<desc>Polaris is a 1-player, single screen shoot-em-up, baring many similarities to Taito's most famous shoot-em-up, "Space Invaders", in which a player takes on the role of Commander of a Polaris class nuclear submarine. War has been declared and the Polaris' mission is to defend the country from enemy attack.

In battle, players must defend against wave after wave of enemy planes (fighter jets and missile-dropping bi-planes) as well as enemy subs and destroyers. Players must also be careful to avoid the many mines and depth charges that litter the ocean.

		<name>Pole Position II </name>
		<desc>Pole Position II is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at four different raceways - the Fuji Speedway in Japan, the Test Track (an oval track like Indy), the Seaside Speedway (with the Long Beach Pike in the background), and the Suzuka Speedway in Japan. The unique and picturesque scenery around each raceway adds exciting realism to each race! 

The player drives a Formula-1 race car on each track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the time, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives the remainder of his time along the qualifying course. 

As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible, and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. The player is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). 

To start play, the player must first insert the correct number of coin(s) for a game (according to the coin dip switch settings, 1 coin/1 credit is the default for both 'Coin A' and 'Coin B' dips). The player then turns the steering wheel until the track he or she wants to drive on is highlighted in white. The game starts when the player steps on the accelerator. The player's car will appear behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses. 

If the player has qualified, just before the race begins, the player's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap. (The player's car is always placed at the 8th position in the attract mode.) 

The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, water puddles, and road signs. (All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion (Pole Position II adds flying debris to the visual effect). The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car even more than in the original "Pole Position". 

Experience will teach the player which turns on which tracks require slight steering (because they're banked) and which turns require fast and forceful steering. The player jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the track and the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. 

The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appear last. Each track has its own separate high score list.

		<desc>Pole Position is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at the Fuji Speedway in Japan. The country around the speedway consists of green meadows, hills, and snow-capped Mt. Fuji. 

The player drives a Formula-1 race car on the track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the clock, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives out the remainder of the time along the qualifying course.

The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible and to achieve the highest score possible.

Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car. 

Racing into the first turn, the player must let up on the accelerator slightly to make the corner. Road signs flash along the side of the track. Depending on how well the player manipulates the controls, he or she can either roar through the hairpin turns like a champion or spin out in a flaming crash. He or she jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. 

The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last.

		<name>Pole Position (Atari version 2) </name>
		<desc>The spectacular arcade game, Pole Position, takes on an exciting new look through the magic of Vectrex! Experience all the challenge of a Grand Prix racing event with non-stop action that'll leave you breathless!

Do you possess the skill, dexterity and courage to pull out from the crowd for qualification in one of the exclusive starting positions... or will you end up as an also ran?

Pole Position transports you into the exciting sport of world class Grand Prix auto racing.  Buckle yourself into your high performance Formula I racer, adjust your safety helmet and get ready for an exhilarating and danger-filled challenge.

You first goal in Pole Position is to race through a lap fast enough to qualify for one of the four exclusive starting positions -- passing competitors and avoiding hazardous obstacles along the way.  Once you have qualified, your challenge continues into four successive laps as you race to maintain your position and complete laps in progressively shorter time periods.

As the game begins, you'll find yourself at the starting line of the world renowned Fuji Speedway.  The words "Prepare To Qualify" will travel across the screen and you will hear the sound of your engine starting. The moment your engine sound begins, you should take off on your qualifying lap. Press buttons 3 or 4 to accelerate.  When you hear your engine laboring, change to second gear by pressing button 2.  (Your speed will never exceed 135 m.p.h. in first gear.) You can return to first gear during your lap by pressing button 1.

While you speed through your qualifying lap, be sure to avoid your competitors' racers and the treacherous obstacles in the roadway -- contact will mean loss your car! There will be no warning of obstacles, so pay close attention to the condition of the track.  Steer your car to avoid hazards and gain a better track position by pushing the joystick either left or right.

Although you are provided with an unlimited number of cars in Pole Position, you will lose a great deal of time whenever a car is crashed. So be careful! It is possible to drive off the speedway track -- but doing so will slow you down, cost you valuable time and increase your chances of losing a car.

You are provided with 120 seconds to complete your qualifying lap although you must complete the lap well ahead of 120 seconds to qualify for on of the four starting positions.  If you qualify, you will be provided with 90 seconds to complete your first actual race lap. Completion of the first lap within the 90 second time period permits you to continue with a second, third and fourth lap which must be completed in 60 seconds.  During the actual race, the time remaining on the clock after completion of a lap will be carried over to the next lap -- allowing you more than the usual time provided to complete the lap.

Game play will continue until you are unable to complete a lap in the allowable time or when you have completed all four race laps. If you complete all four laps, you'll receive 200 bonus points for each second remaining on the clock!

You will also earn points for distance traveled on the track, competitor's cars passed, and having achieved a starting position on your qualifying lap.

		<name>Pole Position (Atari version 1) </name>
		<desc>POLE POSITION consists of two races: the Qualifying Lap and the Grand Prix. In both races you're racing against time and other cars. The longer you race and the more cars you pass, the more points you score. You earn 10,000 points for completing a lap and 50 bonus points for each car you pass. A lap is one complete circuit of the race course.

The Qualifying Lap is 90 seconds long, but you must complete it in 73 seconds (L/73''00) or less to qualify for a position in the Grand Prix.

If you don't qualify, you can continue racing until the Race Timer counts down to zero. Then your car stops, a bonus for the number of cars passed is added to your score, and the game ends.

If you qualify, your car is positioned for the Grand Prix and a bonus for qualifying is added to the 10,000 points you scored for completing the lap. The faster your lap time, the better your position and the bigger your qualifying bonus. Go for POLE POSITION, the number one starting spot. It's worth 4000 bonus points.

In the Grand Prix, your object is to finish the race in the shortest possible time. At the end of the last lap, a time bonus for each second left on the Race Timer is added to your score, in addition to a bonus for the number of cars passed.

The race is four laps long. Complete each lap before the Race Timer runs out to earn 'extended play' time and go on racing. If the timer runs out before you finish a lap, your car stops, your passing bonus is added to your score, and the game ends.

		<name>Pomping World (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Pomping World is the conversion by Hudson Soft of the popular arcade game originally developed by Capcom. The goal of the game is extremely simple: The player (or 2 simultaneously) has to clean up all the huge colored bouncing spheres on screen. But, in a way similar to Atari's Asteroid, each time a ball is hit, it pops and splits in two, and in two, and so on - all in all, a standard ball can split up to eight times. And if a ball, even tiny, hits the player then he loses a precious life. The player can use several weapons to pop them up, from standard vertical Harpoons to fast Laser-Guns. But the player must watch out for the small creatures that wonder around the play field and that will freeze the active weapon for a short amount of time. Power-ups of course appear from time to time to help our bubble-buster in his journey, such as freeze-time options and special hook that can stick to walls. The game is divided into different group of stages which all represent a different location in the World like the Taj Mahal or Paris. (this feature certainly reminds us of Capcom's Street Fighters).

		<desc>Popeye is a superb and demanding platform game featuring characters from the famous King Features Syndicate cartoon show of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus (originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return).

Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Swee'Pea, the Sea Hag, and her vulture Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.

Many games require skill and accuracy, such as shooting cardboard cutouts of criminals, a one-shot chance at hitting a leaf, aiming for a specific toy from a shelf, and shooting at objects that move across the screen or rush towards the player.

Your 'judgement' is based on your shooting accuracy in some games, and others require you to hit a certain number of targets within the given time.

		<name>PuckMan (Japan set 3) </name>
		<desc>Puckman is the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Puckman around a single-screen maze eating dots. Puckman is constantly pursued in his task by four colored ghosts. Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Puckman losing a life. When all of Puckman's lives are lost, the game is over.

Power pills are situated in each corner of the rectangular maze and eating one of these makes Puckman temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Puckman. But watch out...a flashing blue ghost indicates that the power pill is about to wear off and the ghosts are about to transform back to their former selves again. Once Puckman eats a blue ghost, this 'skinned' ghost then becomes visible as a pair of eyes only, will return to the ghost pen in the middle of the maze, regenerate into its former self, and return to the maze to continue its pursuit of Puckman. 

Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 power pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty (the action increases in speed and power pills decrease in effectiveness). 

Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghost pen. Puckman can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on each side of the maze that Puckman can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Puckman, making escape a little easier. 

Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Puckman and the ghosts in funny situations. Three intermissions are present: 
1) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, having turned blue, followed by a giant Puckman! This intermission is played after Round 2. 
2) The red ghost is again chasing Puckman, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. 
3) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then the ghost reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Rounds 9, 13 and 17. 

No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

		<desc>The player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, who must fight his way through six increasingly larger-than-life boxers to earn the title of 'Champ' in this superb 1-on-1 fighting game.

During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wire-frame (so the player's opponent can be seen). Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer.

The player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.

		<desc>Puzzle Club is a sliding block puzzle video game. The objective of each stage is to make every row in the puzzle show matching animated icons before the timer reaches zero. Once a row is matched that row is shifted to the bottom of the puzzle.  Once all of the rows are matched the stage is completed and the players score is tallied.

There is a 'young' mode and 'adult' mode that is selected at the start of the game. The 'young' mode features icons and characters from the pac-man series.  The 'adult' mode features standard slot game icons. The 'adult' mode also features a bonus stage between regular stages, featuring a sliding puzzle with the animated image of a girl lifting barbells. If the player solves the puzzle within the short time limit he is awarded extra bonus points.

		<desc>Taisen Puzzle-Dama is a puzzle game and series by Konami.  It features gameplay very similar to Sega's "Puyo-Puyo" games.  'Coins' drop in sets of two's from the top of the screen and players must form chains of three or more same colored coins to make them disappear.

The game is set up as a two player versus style game with CPU opponents for the single player game.  Clearing multiple chains at a time sends locked coins to the other side.  These locked coins are enclosed in clear boxes which are removed when a nearby coin is cleared from the screen.  This can set off more chains which adds to the strategy of the game.

If the coins get stacked up to the top of the screen then the player loses the game.  Upon continuing the player will restart the same match.

		<name>Q*bert's Qubes </name>
		<desc>The object of Q*bert's Qubes is to jump around diamond formation of 25 cubes and rotate them so that one or more rows of cubes match the shown target cube (a tic-tac-toe) while avoiding the meltniks, the rat and the purple guys. Jumping on anything green is safe, catching the turtle slows down enemies for a short time and catching the freeze ball freezes enemies for a short time.

Each level has four rounds and a bonus round and there are 11 levels...
Level 1 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 2 colors
Level 2 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 3 colors
Level 3 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes have 6 colors from this point on
Level 4 : get 2 tic-tac-toes
Level 5 : get 3 tic-tac-toes
Level 6 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 7 : get 2 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 8 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 9 : get 4 tic-tac-toes
Level 10 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated
Level 11 : get 3 tic-tac-toes

After this levels 9-11 repeat indefinitely.

		<name>Q*bert (early test version) </name>
		<desc>The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each Level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each Level. Each level consists of four Rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).

The game play starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping on the rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two Rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top level and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To destroy Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.

Starting at the 3rd Round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third Round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right sides of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left sides of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third Round and every Round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.

During the 4th Round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second level from the top and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*Bert. Hopping Q*Bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.

Throughout the remaining Rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.

To add variety to the game, the disks will change positions every Round, and in the higher Levels the number of disks will change.

During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This mean: that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the destination color, completing the Round.

Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining Rounds, and Levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination color, but if Q*Bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination color, it will change again.

Here is a rundown of how all the colors change :

Legend :
S - Starting Color
I - Intermediate Color
D - Destination color

LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : During the 4th round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).

LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.

LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.

LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.

LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.

There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5000 points at Level 5.

		<desc>The objective of Qix is to claim a certain proportion of the playing field as your own. At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.

Quantum was also the first game to allow player to 'draw' his name with the trackball when he gets the high score.

		<desc>The Object: You are a rabbit trying to get through the Mysterious Meadow and the Land of Ledges to start a family and make it grow.

The Situation: Meadow meanies are trying to prevent you from getting to your friend, the turtle, who will carry you down the river to the Land of Ledges. Sneaky snakes, bothersome butterflies, chattering choppers and other meanies will send you back to the top of the Meadow or take away one of your chances. If you avoid all these obstacles and leap atop the turtle, you will go to the Land of Ledges.

Here, you will hop from ledge to ledge, attempting to turn them all into one magic color. But beware of a heartless man who will interfere by dropping rocks and undoing all your hopping efforts. If you do succeed in changing all the ledges into the magic color, you will go to the Bunny Bushes and start your family.

Each level of play consists of three screens:
Screen 1: The Mysterious Meadow
Screen 2: The Land of Ledges
Screen 3: The Bunny Bushes

		<name>Rabio Lepus (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Rabio Lepus Special is an horizontal shooter and a remixed version of the arcade game Rabio Lepus originally released by V-System in 1987. In a faraway Kingdom, the king and his two daughters are happy and there is peace and harmony in the land. That is until one fateful day when an unknown spaceship appears like a bolt out of the blue and kidnaps the king and the two girls, all dressed in their bunny suits. The player assumes control of Usagi, a flying robotic-rabbit and his mission is to rescue the captives and eliminate their unknown captors. The rocket-powered rabbit comes equipped with a Vulcan gun and a set of homing missiles. Missiles are supplied in limited quantities and must be refilled frequently. Interestingly, Rabio Lepus Special doesn't reward the player with power-ups. Large carrot-cans are scattered around the levels and drop various items when destroyed such as carrots (life), money jars (points), missiles, raccoons (short invincibility) or a cute yellow hair bow (increases the missiles destruction power) - but nothing is available to boost up the main weapon. However, the rabbit's ultimate weapon are his fists and boxing gloves - when in close range, he can land a punch and inflict a lot more damage to the enemy. Rabio Lepus Special features six stages and three main locations - space station, asteroid and finally the planet surface where the enemy leader hides.

		<name>Radar Scope </name>
		<desc>As captain of the Sonic Spaceport, players must defend their station against enemy spaceships called Gamma Raiders, which attack with vengeance and swiftly retreat to formation. The object of the game is to destroy 48 enemy Gamma Raiders before there is total disintegration of all the Spaceports on the player's side.

Players can counterattack with the Rapid-Fire Laser Blaster which zooms the lasers over the three-dimensional-esque field of curving vectors, while it intercepts enemies. The lower on the radar screen that you destroy a Gamma Raider, the more points will be earned. If exploding decoys damage the Sonic Spaceport, the Laser Blaster's firing speed will reduce. The Laser Blaster's "Damage Meter" will light up as damage is incurred and when fully illuminated, will weaken the Laser Blaster's offensive powers. To reverse this, the players must attack and destroy all remaining Gamma Raiders.

Players are given a wide range of flexibility in controlling the difficulty levels of the game. Extra Spaceports are awarded at 7,000, 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 points, as determined by the players. The initial number of Spaceports may also be pre-programmed at 3, 4, 5 or 6. When the required number of spaceships is destroyed, players receive an extra point bonus.

		<desc>An update of Sega's "Rad Mobile", Rad Rally offered a choice of 4 different courses (Sunset, Rain, Night and Mountain). A fully working rear view mirror was introduced and arcade operators were also given the option of a link-up cabinet for 2-player, head-to-head racing.

		<name>Rad Mobile (World) </name>
		<desc>Another in the long line of ground-breaking racing games from Sega, Rad Mobile is a twenty stage race across America; starting in Los Angeles and finishing in New York. With the game's release, Sega yet again introduced new gameplay elements to the genre, primarily in the form of dynamic weather effects. Sega's 1989 racer, "Turbo Out Run", also included limited weather effects, but they were far less prominent as a gameplay feature and a good deal less impressive than they are here.

Another Sega innovation is that many of Rad Mobile's stages have banked corners; with the car's cockpit view tilting to match the driving surface. Some stages also have police patrols, and players must either avoid or outrun the police cars or risk being pulled over. Being pulled over will result in a loss of valuable seconds.

In addition to the tight time limit, rival drivers (represented as red cars) and heavy, two-way traffic, players now had to contend with heavy rain, thick fog and darkness. Windscreen wipers and headlights had to be manually switched on by the player which, together with the first-person in-car view, gave a more realistic and interactive feel to standard but undeniably superb racing action.

		<path>./rampage2.zip</path>
		<name>Rampage (ver 2 8-4-86) </name>
		<desc>Rampage is a classic B-movie inspired smash-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of three mutated monsters - George the giant ape, Lizzie the giant lizard and Ralph the giant wolf - who move from city to city destroying skyscrapers and vehicles, while eating or killing any people that get in their way. 

The monsters' health can be damaged in a number of ways: by being shot by National Guardsmen, by being hit by another monster, by falling from a building, by being hit by police cars or tanks, by going underwater, by being struck by lightning, or by eating something bad, such as dynamite. Health is replenished by eating food found in damaged buildings. 

If the players' health gauge diminishes completely, the monsters will revert back to their original human form and walk sideways off the screen. Rampage has a "buy back in" option, however; if players chose to continue the game before the human figure leaves the play area, the game will continue from that stage. 

Rampage is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in Peoria, Illinois and ends in Plano, Illinois. In Plano, players receive a mega vitamin bonus which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day One. 

* Examples of bonuses and hazards found inside damaged buildings: 
Food: Milk, Turkey, Hot Toast, Fruit 
Bonus: Flower Pot, TV Set, Money Bag 
Hazard: Cactus, Poison, Toaster 

* Examples of bonuses and hazards found outside damaged buildings: 
Bonus: Auto (or Truck), Commuter Train, Person in Manhole 
Hazard: National Guard Tank, Police Car, Storm Cloud 

Further bonus points can be earned by grabbing a fleeing 'Townie' from a building window. This has two benefits: 1) While holding the Townie, all swat team members disappear from the building windows and 2) accumulating points are scored during the time the Townie is held.

		<name>Ray Force (Ver 2.3A 1994/01/20) </name>
		<desc>A great vertically scrolling shooter, featuring a lock-on secondary weapon.

The player is provided with a powerful ship called the RVA-818 X-LAY, which is outfitted with two weapons: a primary weapon that fires straight lasers and increases in power when the player accumulates power-ups, and a secondary lock-on missile launcher, which can also be increased in power, that can target up to eight enemies at once by moving the targeting reticle. This weapon is used to attack enemies that appear on a lower plane than that of your aircraft, which are inaccessible to the player's primary weapon. 

The plot centers in the distant future, human governments, across the planet Earth, construct a massive supercomputer, named "Con-Human". The purpose of this computer is to govern the planet's environmental systems, verifying proper nutrients and care is provided to ensure the culture of humans and animal alike.

However, disaster strikes when, after a cloned human's mind is linked with the system, Con-Human becomes sentient and insane. It begins to induce calamities across the planet, constructing corrupt clones of existing organisms, destroying its human masters and exterminating the nature it was intended to protect, apparently intending to replace everything with what Con-Human considers improved versions of themselves.

After prolonged war, Con-Human has succeeded in exterminating 99.8% of humankind, with the remnants fleeing to space colonies. Meanwhile, Con-Human remakes the very interior of Earth. As a result, Earth, as humanity knew it, has utterly ceased to exist, transformed into a planet-sized mobile fortress that is in fact Con-Human's body. Con-Human intends to use the transformed Earth to seek out and destroy the colonies, erasing all remaining traces of old life from the universe and leaving only the new life that it personally created. Now, taking the full-scale offensive, mankind develops powerful ships, one of them the RVA-818 X-LAY starfighter, to fight the oppressive machine by destroying the now-infected Earth entirely.

		<name>Ray Storm (Ver 2.06A) </name>
		<desc>3-D follow up to Rayforce featuring a lock-on laser system.

A sequel of RayForce that does not follow the main plot "Con-Human" storyline, to this time the plot consists of eight stages taking place between August 4 and August 7, 2219 AD; the first three stages take place on Earth, the last three at the fictional planet Secilia, and two between them in the orbits of Earth and Secilia, respectively. Whereas RayForce players must head toward Earth to destroy it, RayStorm players start at and move away from the planet. The plot of the game is exposed minimally during play, with only dates and place names given at the start of each of its first seven stages. An "Extra Mode" included with home versions of the game displays maps before the first seven stages and a closing crawl after completing the game, which further illustrate the plot; the map for the fifth stage, for example, shows that a "gravity catapult" at the Moon is used to travel from Earth orbit to Secilia orbit.

In a future where space travel has existed since 2119. Humans explored space, and within 100 years Earth established a twenty-colony Star Federation extending to Orion, with each colony kept under martial law. The colonies then mutinied against the Federation: they took control of the major colony Secilia, formed the Secilia Federation and defeated Earth's forces after many battles. After Earth's surrender, all of its inhabitants had been transferred to the colonies. The Secilia Federation suppressed colonial opposition and sent out a force to destroy the planet completely. However, by then the R-Gray, a aircraft made with parts salvaged from 13 different Secilia ships, is completed and deployed to carry out OPERATION RAYSTORM, a desperate attempt to defend Earth from the Federation.

		<name>Red Baron (Revised Hardware) </name>
		<desc>2,795 at its release. Only 504 units were produced.

Red Baron was designed to accurately recreate World War I aerial combat. It was definitely the first flight simulator available to the public back in 1980. Red Baron was a lot like "Battlezone" in the air. Which made a lot of sense, because Red Baron ran on almost exactly the same hardware as Battlezone (more information below), and most Red Baron Upright machines shipped in factory-converted Battlezone cabinets (they usually even have Battlezone sideart underneath the red 'Iron Cross' sideart). Unfortunately this game never did as well as Battlezone did, the game did poorly in the arcades. Maybe the world just wasn't ready for a 3-D flight simulator?

Red Baron used almost the exact same hardware as Battlezone, but not quite. Battlezone will run on Red Baron hardware with a few minor modifications, but Red Baron will not run on Battlezone hardware without a Red Baron 'auxiliary board', as the Battlezone auxiliary board did not have enough sockets for all the Red Baron ROM chips. The two games control completely different though.

Last Alert is a military action game and the player's goal is to guide Guy Kazama and stop the evil Dr. Garcia, helped by an arsenal of different weapons and other offensive items. The game counts six vast areas, from a gigantic enemy base to a deep jungle or snowing and icy terrain. Levels are split into different sub-missions. You will either have to clean up an area and defeat the boss, or strategically drop bombs or rescue hostages. You start with a simple shot gun, but you can acquire more experience as you defeat enemies and gain levels and classes. As your ranks gets higher, you access better and more powerful weapons.

Unfortunately, Rezon lacks any of R*Type's innovations in either level design or the weapons available to the player. One attribute it does share with the Irem classic, however, is that it is extremely difficult.

		<name>Ribbit! </name>
		<desc>Ribbit! is a one or co-operative two-player abstract arcade game and is an unofficial sequel to Konami's seminal 1981 release, "Frogger".

Unlike its legendary prequel (in which players had to guide a frog to his home at top of each screen without being killed) the aim here is to guide a toad around a screen, eating benign insects - such as Ants and Dragon-flies - while avoiding harmful ones - such as Spiders and Rats. A level is only complete once a set amount of insects have been eaten.

Ribbit's stages take place over a number of different locations, including a sandy desert, a beach and - in tribute to the original game - on a fast flowing river with logs and turtles acting as platforms.

Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed within 60 seconds - with the amount earned dictated by how quickly the stage is completed. A bonus round also appears after every third stage, in which players must run over as many of either flowers or mushrooms as possible to make them bloom.

		<desc>The goal of the game is to jump out of the plane and land safely on one of the many targets down below. The challenge is to avoid the numerous enemy helicopters that occupy the sky in between your plane and the ground.

You control the timing of your jump with the Jump button, at which point your parachutist begins hurtling toward the ground out of control. Pressing the D-Ring button shortly afterwards releases the chute and slows your descent. More importantly, it allows you at this point to control your left/right position via the paddle control to help you avoid the enemies.

You can select any of the 16 different game play options. Each game play option determines the number of available fuel cells and which characters can wraparound the screen.

Your pirate-destroying ship will appear on the right side of the screen. In a two player game, a second pirate-destroying ship will appear on the left side of the screen.  Your fuel cells will be in the center. You must guard your fuel cells from the pirates who will try to steal them. The pirates can appear from anywhere on the screen. Steer your ship with either the joystick or buttons 1 and 2, for left and right rotation. Move your ship forward by pressing button 3. Press button 4 to fire lasers at the pirates. The pirates can be destroyed by colliding with them, but you will then have to wait for your new pirate-destroying ship to appear before you can fire more lasers. The game is over when all the fuel cells are stolen.

		<name>Riot City (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Riot City is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players who take on the roles of 'Paul' or 'Bobby', two talented fighters who are given the task of breaking a drug syndicate known as "MID". It has also been discovered that Paul's girlfriend has been kidnapped by the syndicate and must be rescued.

MID's hideout is located on Riot Island, an island full of abandoned, run-down buildings that has since become a slum. Locations include apartments, a hospital, a factory and a casino.

Riot City is practically a direct copy of Capcom's superb 'Final Fight', with both gameplay and graphical style heavily copied from the 1989 classic. One gameplay difference is that Riot City does not allow players to pick up and use weapons as they can in Final Fight, although bonus items found in various containers can be collected.

Hidden bonus items have also been added to the game; two examples are an item that allows any player character to transport to almost any location in the game instantly.

		<desc>Everyone knew the war was coming. Tensions had been building for months - not between the Superpowers as had always been thought, but between rival factions in our own government. What no one expected was the severity of the damage.

Nuclear weapons devastated the surface of the planet, released by ruthless Death Squads intent on controlling the planet. Millions perished in a sudden flash of heat more intense than a Sahara summer.

When it was all over, only a handful of decent people remained. A few good people, and thousands of Death Squad members. It was obvious that the Death Squads had planned this for years. They were ready. They had developed cities and weapons impervious to nuclear war. And vehicles. They had cars that could withstand the highest levels of radiation and the most dangerous heat. They also had huge stockpiles of food and medicine that would keep them alive until the nuclear winder ends.

Fortunately, a right-thinking scientist saw what was happening. He defected from the Death Squads and brought with him a small prototype vehicle and a few weapons capable of destroying Death Squad cars and cannon towers. Only one person can fit in the prototype, and you were chosen.

Now, just for the amusement of Death Squad leaders, there is to be a road rally, a dangerous race for time and distance along a highway laced with deadly mines and cannon towers. Posing as a Death Squad driver you join the rally, hoping to drive undetected into the very heart of the Death Squad territory where you will defeat their leaders. your only helper is a small, robot-powered jet that will bring you additional weapons from Headquarters. The odds are definitely against you.

The nuclear wind blows dust across the highway. Now and then the burnt skeleton of a tumbleweed blows across the once-fertile plain. The world is desolate. All hope for a decent future rests on your narrow shoulders.

		<name>Robby Roto </name>
		<desc>When playing this game. YOU are ROTO's mentor. He takes his directions ONLY from YOU and will do your bidding exclusively. YOU determine the strategies he will use to defeat the evil monster VOLTAR who has invaded the Earth, stealing all types of treasures and burying them deep within the earth. VOLTAR also takes hostages and seals them in vaults deep within the earth.

There is only one way to save the hostages and recover the stolen treasures. We must send in ROTO. He will follow VOLTAR right into his own home tunnels to rescue the hostages and recover the stolen treasures VOLTAR has salted away.

To say the least, this makes VOLTAR more than just a little bit upset with ROTO. To help protect his stolen treasures and kidnapped hostages. VOLTAR has developed a breed of giant SPIDER that can sense ROTO's location and that can also travel through solid earth. These SPIDERS attempt to corner and capture ROTO. And to direct their hunt for ROTO, VOLTAR turns himself into a TROLL that can travel through solid earth.

If and when ROTO is captured by the SPIDERS or the TROLL, he is forcibly ejected from VOLTAR’s tunnels and you loose one player.

As your skill level increases and you get into the higher racks of the game, the ability of the SPIDERS and the TROLL to sense ROTO's location increases. This makes ROTO's chances of survival considerably smaller And VOLTAR, being what he is, has reinforcements in the form of a set of disembodied TEETH that he can call on to help him track ROTO down and put the bite on him. These TEETH also have the ability to travel through solid earth.

ROTO has no reinforcements he can call on to help him defend himself against his enemies. He has ONLY YOUR SKILL at maneuvering and forming strategies plus one use of the MAGIC button (which makes ROTO and any hostages he has with hlm invisible to all monsters for a short period of time) per rack to keep him safe as he carries out his rescue missions.

Bonus ROTOs are awarded to you periodically throughout the game: after you complete every third rack of the game. Each recaptured treasure and rescued hostage has an assigned point value as listed below. In the 2 times and 3 times racks, the values of all items are doubled or tripled respectively.

		<desc>A single player, side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up based on the 1987 movie of the same name. The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a quest to bring down the evil OCP corporation.

RoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being into-the-screen target ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Wooden crates occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, but these can be punched to remove them. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun.

The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.

		<name>Robot Bowl </name>
		<desc>You have a top down view of a bowling alley with score cards shown on each side. The only thing in the game that uses an actual animation is the bowler himself, the robot has a several frame animation when he walks. Everything is (of course) shown in glorious monochrome black and white. The game begins with your robot bowler running up to the alley (his feet move faster than he does, which makes it look like he is running on a conveyor belt or something). You then have three seconds to roll the ball, before it will roll of its own accord. The game is controlled with five buttons, they are left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. When Exidy was making this game, they had to make a decision about how the hooking worked, and it seems that they decided that "Robots are telepaths, and can effect the balls movement after it is thrown!". You see you can't even hook the ball until after it is thrown. This makes it very easy to pick up the spare. The game makes up for that little trick by making 'splits' very common (the 7-10 split and the 4-7-10 split come up all the time). These are pretty annoying, but you can usually learn how to clear them out (except the 7-10 split, I still haven't figured out how to clear that one).

		<desc>Is the Golden Roc merely a myth? Or does it really exist? Find out in Coleco's ROC'N ROPE, a game of skill and speed.

In your quest for the Golden Roc, you'll travel through a prehistoric landscape made up of hazardous ledges and treacherous cliffs.
Scale the heights with your trusty rope and use your powerful flashlight to daze the lumbering dinosaurs and the swift footed cavemen.
Fortunately, the Golden Roc has left a trail of magical eggs. Gather them as you go and use their powers to make the dinosaurs and cavemen disappear. But watch your step! If you slip while on the edge of a cliff, you'll plummet to the depths below!
The treasures of the Golden Roc are yours when you reach the summit. But you must journey on. The fabled bird awaits you at the top of another perilous climb!

Roc 'n Rope features 8 game variations:
Game 1 = One-Player, Skill 1 
Game 2 = One-Player, Skill 2 
Game 3 = One-Player, Skill 3 
Game 4 = One-Player, Skill 4
Game 5 = Two-Player, Skill 1 
Game 6 = Two-Player, Skill 2 
Game 7 = Two-Player, Skill 3 
Game 8 = Two-Player, Skill 4

Skill 1 is the easiest, suitable for play by beginners or younger players.
Skill 2 is a little harder. Enemies are more dangerous.
Skill 3 is a perilous journey. Your enemies are hot on your heels!
Skill 4 is the toughest challenge of all!

		<desc>Yousei Monogatari Rod Land is a cute single-screen platform game by Jaleco, conversion of their own arcade game released back in 1990. The fairy village is under attack and all the inhabitants have been turned into monsters. And yet it was only the beginning. The player takes control of Rin (and/or Tam) whose mother has been kidnapped and kept prisoner at the top of the mysterious Mab?tsu tower standing outside the village. The young fairies don't come empty handed and are equipped with the Sh?sanomo Wand, the last gift they ever received from their adored dad. They can grab enemies with the staff and repeatedly slam the poor foes against the ground to safely dispose of them. They drop special weapons when killed which can then be picked up and used against other enemies - they range from bombs, missiles, bouncing balls and dynamite. As well as the wands, the fairies can use their Rainbow shoes to create magical ladders and reach higher (or lower) grounds. This technique is also particularly suited to escape or track down running enemies. The main goal of the game is to clear each level from monsters, however there is an alternate way. The fairies can also collect all the flowers on screen - this will turn all the left over monsters that survived into red plum/peach looking enemies. In this mode, defeated foes drop letter icons that can be combined to form the word "EXTRA" and award the player with an extra life. A two simultaneous player mode is available and options allow the player to customize the fairies' features (change their color, names and even allow them to jump).

		<desc>The Return of Lady Frog is an adult puzzle game where the player uses bombs to clear the background and completely reveal the nude photographic image underneath.

Each bomb clears away a nine square grid from the background. Bombs can also be used to clear gray square barriers.  But bombs do no damage to the balloons. if a balloon rolls over the bomb as it explodes then it snuffs out the explosion and reveals nothing. In order to clear the balloons the player can shoot bottle-rockets at them. The balloons explode to drop items for points or break apart into smaller balloons. Balloons labeled with a scull and crossbones cannot be killed and must be avoided. If a player is hit by the balloons then the player is killed. The game is over when the player loses all of his lives.

		<desc>The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

		<name>R-Type Leo (World) </name>
		<desc>The third and final arcade release of this classic series (which would foster three further console-only sequels, see 'Series' for details) sees the Bydo Empire waging a full scale assault against other planets. 

R*Type Leo possesses many of the elements that made the first two games in the series such classics, but the feel and gameplay is very different. Both the beam laser and the pod make a return, but play a different role in this game. The pod in particular now acts more like a mini 'smart bomb', in that it only detaches from the player's ship for a few seconds, and automatically homes in on enemies. The level design is also far more open than that of its predecessors, and far more forgiving.

R*Type Leo is a game that firmly divides opinions of fans of the series. Some considered it to be a blasphemy to the R*Type name, arguing that in making a game far more 'traditional', both in feel and level design, R-type Leo actually represented a step backwards from what the innovative original achieved. Less patient players undoubtedly prefer Leo's open levels and forgiving gameplay. Something that all can agree on, however, is how stunningly beautiful the game is. The detail and use of colour on both the backgrounds and enemy ships is incredible and is one of the finest examples of two-dimensional artwork the arcade has ever seen.

		<desc>R*Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.

The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R*Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.

The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R*Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage.

R*Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.

		<name>Strikers 1945 Plus </name>
		<desc>After inserting quarters and hitting the Start button, the player chooses one of 6 planes (plus 1 hidden plane) or can opt for a random choice.

The available fighters are :
* P-38 Lightning
* Vought XF5U 'Flying Pancake'
* Spitfire Mk. VI
* Zero Type 52
* Focke Wulf Ta 152
* Fiat G.56
* XP-55 Ascender (Hidden) 

The first 4 stages are in random order, while the last 4 are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique 'supershot' which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.

After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the 4 bosses that are randomly chosen and the 6th boss is changed.

		<desc>This game was in black and white, not greyscale (like many early games used), but just 2 colors, black and white. But the characters and animals were large, and very detailed for just using a single color. There were 4 different animals that you could hunt. Snakes and lions were both rather slow moving, and good for 100 points each. Wild boars would run quickly across the screen, but would net you 200 for a kill. Finally, vultures were small and would move around erratically near the top of the screen (being worth 300 points if you could hit them). Touching any of the beasties meant instant death, but it mattered little, because this game played on time limits anyway. Death only meant that you would lose a few seconds waiting for your intrepid big game hunter to reappear (the game lasted 90 seconds total).

		<name>Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon (Ver. 95/03/22B, Europe) </name>
		<desc>A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss.

As with Capcom's "Final Fight", and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the 'special attack' move. This works in a similar way to Sega's "Shinobi", with every enemy on the screen taking a hit.

Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game's enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier's signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.

		<desc>A one or two player shoot-em-up released ten years after the game it sequels, Salamander 2 remains faithful to the superb 1986 original; retaining both the organic look and feel of the graphics, as well as the horizontal and vertically scrolling levels. While the game doesn't break any new ground gameplay-wise, and is little more than a retread of (and tribute to) the original game, what it does it does very well; and the graphics in particular are nothing short of stunning.

		<desc>A direct sequel to 1988's "Chase H.Q.", S.C.I. once again puts the player in charge of an unmarked police car - this time a Nissan 300ZX T-Top Turbo - in which the player must chase and capture a criminal mastermind before the time limit expires. Graphically, S.C.I. is very similar to its predecessor, although there are slight improvements with both a better use of colour and the introduction of some new weather effects; such as the rain on the first stage. Unlike the first game, the player is armed with a gun; this is used to take out criminals and roadblocks as the player races against the time limit, and also to capture the criminal mastermind and make an arrest before the time limit expires.

		<name>Super Contra (Japan) </name>
		<desc>The sequel to "Contra" - released a year earlier - is set in the year 2634 and begins with the disturbing news that the alien invaders from the first game - a race known as the Red Falcon - have renewed their attack on Earth and have infiltrated military bases and possessed most of the federation forces troops. 

The heroes of the first games - Bill Rizer and Lance Bean - are once again called upon to defend the Earth and defeat the alien invaders. 

Super Contra plays identically to its predecessor, with the usual mix of run-and-gun gameplay. The main difference is that the into-the-screen stages of the original Contra have been replaced with overhead stages. In addition, power-up icons are now represented as the actual weapons wielded by the characters, instead of the traditional letter-based falcon icons and players can now upgrade their weapon by picking it up twice in a row. 

Another new gameplay addition is that players can now control the height of their jump; holding the joystick up and pressing the jump button allows for a higher jump; likewise the player can perform low jumps by holding down-right or down-left while pressing the jump button. 

The available weapons are as follows: 

* Machine Gun - Fires bullets at auto-fire. The upgraded version increases the firing rate to a near-ridiculous speed. 

* Bomb Launcher - Fires bombs that spread fire when they hit their target. The upgraded version causes bigger explosions. 

* Laser Rifle - Fires a powerful laser beam once per shot. The upgraded version fires a larger beam. 

* Spread Shot - Fires a three-way shot. Increases to a five-way spread after the upgrade. 

* Mega Shell - Available only in the top-view stages. After picking it up, players can launch it by pressing the jump button and kill all on-screen enemies. 

Super Contra's five stages are: 

* Area 1 - Outer Base (side-view) - A military base overrun by possessed soldiers. Bosses include a manned tank and a possessed helicopter. At the end of the level, players must destroy a core protected by a pair of snipers and a grenade thrower to gain entrance to the next area. 

* Area 2 - Inner Base (top-view) - A tank hanger filled with manned tanks and cannons, in addition to enemy soldiers. The end-of-level boss is the Hyper Electric Magnetic Tank Magnus, which is manned by three gunners. 

* Area 3 - Jungle (side-view) - Enemies come from trees as players progress through the level. The heroes will sometimes have to cross a lake, and players can duck into it to avoid enemy fire. Towards the end of the level, the heroes are faced with alien eggs that produce facehugger-like creatures (the same ones featured in the original game). The end-of-level boss is an alien shrine with a skull. 

* Area 4 - 1st Alien Lair (side-view) - This takes place inside an alien nest. The enemies are now xenomorph-like creatures and mutant mouths that shoot alien spawns. The sub-boss is an alien hovercraft composed of skulls, while the end-of-level boss is a flying alien. 

* Area 5 - 2nd Alien Lair (top-view) - The final stage, filled with mouths emerging from the ground, flying heads and spider-like creatures. The final boss is Gaver, a giant alien head with snake-like arms.

		<desc>Watch out for that next mountain! Maneuver your ship over a rough terrain in an effort to destroy the enemy base. Careful piloting alone won't get you to your destination... you must brave rockets, UFOs, flamoids and some very tight tunnels.  Few people have ever seen the enemy base, let alone destroy it. Will you be one of the select few?

Your ship will immediately come into view and the landscape of the first part of your journey will begin moving beneath you. Use the joystick to maneuver your ship across the terrain, avoiding the mountains and other obstacles. Press button 3 to drop bombs. Press button 4 to fire lasers at the obstacles. If you are successful in piloting through that section of the terrain, you will immediately fly to the next, more difficult part of the planet. If you successfully travel through all levels, you will eventually reach the enemy base.

		<name>Scramble (bootleg on Galaxian hardware) </name>
		<desc>Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of a spaceship and must try to fight through six different enemy-packed levels - destroying as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible - before reaching the enemy base and destroying it. 

Contact with any scenery, ground installations, enemy ships or projectyles results in an instant loss of life. The Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs. The blaster is forward-firing only while the bombs drop downwards to target ground-based enemy installations and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. 

The fuel dumps are of particular importance, as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly depletes as the player progresses through the game and the only way to re-fuel is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located on the ground throughout the levels. Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible. 

Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.

Your character, Robop, must navigate his way around a playfied shooting records, snipes and bees to earn points. Gathering hamburgers, nuts, briefcases and atoms will light up the bulbs. The levels advance when all the bulbs have been lit. Robop must avoid the inchworm and pick up his hands if they become detached from his body. The game ends if all Robop hands are pushed off the screen by the inchworm or he is destroyed by the Cherry Bomb.

The left joystick moves Robop, while the right joystick fires. The joystick buttons activate Robop's Super!Charge that both speeds him up and shields him from attack.

		<desc>The game screen is a side view of a underwater scene (with the surface towards the top). You control a crosshair at the surface level. The object is to shoot as many ships as possible, before the time runs out. Your torpedoes are launched from the bottom of the screen, and must move upwards to hit the enemy ships (while avoiding the mines that float at different levels of the water). There are several different types of enemy ships, from slow moving destroyers, to fast moving PT boats. An 'explosion' light will flash inside your periscope each time you score a hit. Your submarine can shoot five shots before it has to reload (an automatic action that takes about a second). Your game will be extended if you reach a certain score before time runs out (the score is operator adjustable).

		<desc>Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.

The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.

Most of the game's eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game's end-of-level bosses reappear on the final 'underground lair' level.

While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level.

		<desc>Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.

The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.

		<name>Shadow Dancer (bootleg) </name>
		<desc>A loose sequel to 1988's "Shinobi", Shadow Dancer stars a young Ninja who, together with his faithful canine companion, must battle against a terrorist group. The terrorist group have planted a number of time bombs throughout the metropolis. The Ninja and his dog must set out to gather up all the explosives placed by the evil gang and to annihilate the criminal mastermind.

Game-play is very similar to that of the original Shinobi, and features the jumping and projectile weapon-based game-play of its illustrious older brother. However, a new and crucial attacking move has since been added to the Ninja's arsenal. Pulling DOWN on the joystick and pressing the ATTACK button sends the hero's dog to attack the nearest enemy. This will stop the enemy from attacking the player as he wrestles with the dog. The enemy must be killed quickly, however, or the dog itself will be killed. If the dog is attacked, he will turn into a small puppy, and once the player has killed a set number of enemies, the puppy will grow to be a full-sized dog who can once again be used to attack enemies.

		<name>Strider Hiryu 2 (Japan 991213) </name>
		<desc>A direct sequel to the superb 1989 original, the player once again takes on the role of Strider Hiryu; a ninja who wields a deadly plasma-ejecting cypher called the 'Falchion'. Players start the game by selecting one of three difficult missions, with a fourth becoming available once the initial three are completed. Completing the fourth mission will unlock the final 'boss' mission, in which the player must battle a number of bosses which includes the rogue 'Strider Hien' from the first Strider game. Once all missions are completed, the character of Strider Hien - who wields two ranged cyphers - is unlocked.

To add variety to the tight gameplay, Capcom included special unlockable and powerful skills to aid players on their missions. These included the Savage Slash ('Midare-Giri' in Japanese), Hassou Jump, Boost (unlimited if missions defeated by Hien) and rapid slash.

Strider 2 features improved graphics - now rendered in pseudo 3-D - but with hack-and-slash gameplay largely unaltered from the first game. One difference to the original is a greater emphasis placed on boss encounters.

		<desc>More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted.

Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.

		<desc>Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.

Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, "Commando (Capcom)" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '"Mercs". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.

		<name>Satan's Hollow (set 1) </name>
		<desc>Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head. 

The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME! 

Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT : when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN. 

When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player. 

As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also. 

Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value. 

The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.

		<name>Space Invaders (CV Version) </name>
		<desc>Space Invaders is quite simply the most influential video-game of all time. A single player moves an armed 'laser base' left or right along the bottom of the screen and shoots the endless waves of aliens marching relentlessly down the screen towards earth.

There are four buildings (shields) at the bottom of the screen that the player can hide behind, but these will eventually be destroyed by either enemy missiles or by direct contact with the invaders themselves. The player's shots will also destroy the shields.

The aliens' descent quickens as they are eliminated, making them harder to hit. A flying saucer will fly across the top of the screen at regular intervals and can be shot to earn extra points.

		<desc>Side Trak is a black &amp; white man-versus-machine game where the goal is to pick up all of the waiting passengers with your train while avoiding the computer-driver 'killer engine' which aims to take you out in a head-on collision. You can control your train via the 'fast' button which allows you to temporarily increase your speed on the tracks. You can also use the joystick to switch between several tracks at various junction points.

Each time you make a complete circuit around the track and pass the start marker on the outside track, another car is added to your train.

		<name>The Simpsons (4 Players World, set 1) </name>
		<desc>A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.

The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.

		<desc>Your intergalactic crystal-mining mission takes you to the antipodes of the known universe. But your parametric DeepSpace scanner faithfully displays the sector of the galaxy you presently occupy (including an area fully three parsecs across, no less)! 

Keep the galaxy safe for all its sinizens! Fiendish Worker ships from the planet Sporg will attempt to fabricate a Sinistar from the remains of derelict planetoids in your very sector. You must not let them do this for two reasons : 
1) These planetoids contain the life-sustaining crystals that your civilization requires for its vital technologies. 
2) With the eminently unstable Sinistar in their possession, the Sprogites can lay waste to any civilization in your sector. You alone stand in their way. 

You must mine the sinisite crystals. Williams has equipped you with the latest heuristic electret cannon technology. All you need to do is aim at a planetoid and shoot. Now collect your motherlode! 

In fact, only with sinisite can you manufacture sinibombs to eradicate the Sinistar. But you must also rebuff the Workers and disintegrate their even more aggressive comrades-at-arms, the evil skelomorphic Warriors! Intelligent beings everywhere depend on your courage, your dedication, your reserve, your shrewd command of tactical invention! It's up to you, space cadet!

		<desc>This is quite a fun game, where you score points for landing on an ever decreasing patch of 'good' land. Why 'good'? As you descend without opening your parachute your landing point becomes smaller, but the points become higher, just don't leave pulling the ripcord too late because the Newtonian laws concerning gravity is working against you. Each time you successfully land the plane goes lower.

		<desc>Sky Kid is a 2-D, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the character Sky Kid. Sky Kid flies around in a bi-plane and is assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involved bombing specific targets. This would seem easy, however, there are a few obstacles Sky Kid must overcome to get to the target safely. First, the bi-plane is not equipped with the bomb. Sky Kid must pick up the bomb en route to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep Sky Kid from accomplishing his mission. Last, Sky Kid may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets that Sky Kid must bomb will either be a fortress complex or a ship. As one moves farther up in the missions, it isn't uncommon to have multiple targets in one mission. Perhaps barnstorming would have been a better idea.

Fortunately for the player, it is a target-rich environment and the best part is that there are no defenses to fly through. That means you get to bomb targets at will without fear of any enemy fire. Who could ask for a simpler type of game.

		<desc>Slipstream is a sprite-based Formula One racing game featuring four different race tracks; Germany, Japan, Australia and the obligatory Monaco.

players can chose to race in any one of eight different F-1 racing cars, with each offering different levels of handling, acceleration, speed and grip. The game also offers three different play modes; Time Trial (raced over a single course), World Championship (raced over all four courses) and Time Trial (also raced over all four courses).

Each car has a basic high and low gear. Also, as the player races the course, a 'Turbo' meter builds up. The Turbo will occasionally kick in and give the player's car a temporary speed boost. Rival cars are also able to turbo-boost.

Each wall has a moving cannon mounted that will fire odd shaped torpedoes at your ship. Scattered around the inside will be a bunch of pellets in various simple patterns. To complete each level you have to drive over, or shoot all of the pellets. If done quickly enough the game will skip a level (going from 1 to 3, etc).

		<desc>How many types of alien vessels will you be able to destroy? Seven different types are after you. You must first destroy them and then attempt to rescue the survivors before that float into the sun. Don't get your ship too close to the sun... its high temperatures can destroy you.

The first group of aliens will fly on to the screen. Use the joystick to rotate your ship and button 3 to move forward. You must try to destroy the ships before they collide with you. To destroy alien vessels one at a time, press button 4 to fire rockets. You can destroy many alien vessels at the same time by using button 2, the Nuke. Press this button once to fire the Nuke and a second time to release its force. The number of remaining Nukes are shown at the bottom of the screen.

Button 1 allows you to move mysteriously on the screen to avoid begin hit.  Use it cautiously... it might put you in an even more difficult predicament.

Once an alien vessel is destroyed, its survivor will remain and float toward the sun in the center of the screen. You can earn extra points by either destroying the survivors or picking them up in your craft before the sun destroys them.

As the game progresses, new types of aliens, who are even faster and more deadly, will enter the field.

		<desc>The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up "Sonic Wings", players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.

The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.

Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet :
* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao. 
* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien. 
* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver. 
* International F-14 Tomcat piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 
* International YF-23 Black Widow II piloted by Spanky. 
* French Rafale piloted by Steve.

		<desc>The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.

One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.

Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots :
American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. 
American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers. 
Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen piloted by Hien. 
Japanese Aichi M6A1 Seiran piloted by Mao Mao. 
Soviet Il-2 Stormovik piloted by Chaika and Pooshka. 
Soviet Polikarpov I-16 piloted by Spanky. 
German Dornier Do-335 Pfeil piloted by Malcolm ('Pfeil' is german for 'Arrow') 
German Junkers Ju-87 Stuka piloted by Kowful and River. 
British Westland Whirlwind piloted by Alex and Pictus. 
British Fairy Swordfish piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 

There are also 2 secret planes (see the TIPS AND TRICKS section for details) :
The Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit) piloted by Kotomi. 
The Diabloon piloted by The Man.

Planes Spec. :
Vought F4U Corsair can have 3 power-ups and 5 bombs.
Northrop P-61 Black Widow can have 3 power-ups and 7 bombs.

		<name>Son Son </name>
		<desc>Son Son is a side scrolling action game by Capcom and conversion of their own arcade game originally released in 1984. It is loosely based on the old Chinese legend Journey to the west and tells the story of a monk and his long pilgrimage to Tenjiku (ancient India) to retrieve Buddhist scriptures. But soon, the monk and his disciples (lead by Son Son the monkey boy) come under attack and are captured by a flying demon-warrior. Only Son Son and Ton Ton (the pig in two-player cooperative mode) manage to escape, and the duo vows to save their friends and to reach their intended destination. Son Son is not your typical platform game, but rather a mix of platform action and shooting. Each one of the twenty levels (or continuous sections) is made out of six large platforms that span across the screen. The playfield constantly scrolls from right to left, encouraging Son Son to always stay on the move and to jump up or down to higher or lower ground in order to avoid incoming enemies or to collect fruits and other special items. Most of the items available in the game, such as fruits and vegetables, are only good for points (additionally, larger ones appear in front of wooden signs and award the player with even more bonus points). The last power-ups are Capcom's familiar and trademark Pow icons (kill all the enemies on the screen and turns them into fruits and vegetables for points), small Bamboo shoots (they grow behind Son Son) and the Yashichi pinwheel for extra bonus points. Every so often, the screen stops for a short amount of time and unveils a tougher battle against skull blocks, bombers and, later in the game, respawning waves of increasingly difficult enemies and large flying demon-warriors.

		<desc>The mystical sword of the legends, the "Soul Edge", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese kunoichi Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the "Evil Seed", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake.

Three years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them three sacred weapons join once again.

		<name>Space Firebird (rev. 04-u) </name>
		<desc>Space Firebird is a one or two player game in which players are attacked from all sides by highly maneuverable Firebirds. Players can move space ship left or right and shoot a rapid-fire laser at attacking Firebirds. A special Warp Mode allows the space ship to escape danger and fire at the flock of aliens.

FIREBIRDS
The space Firebirds are a unique set of adversaries. There are three different birds, the Emperor, Eagle and Gull, which fly together in complex looping formations, firing and attacking from all directions. The player must keep track of the laser hits because each bird has a different resistance level to hits. The fearless Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the soaring Gull with one hit. The Eagle also has a deadly bomb which is launched at the space ship. Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.

SPACE SHIP
The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.

WARP MODE
Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.

If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed.

		<name>Space Fever (New Ver.) </name>
		<desc>The Earth is under attack from alien invaders. Shoot them out of the sky before they land. Space Fever is Nintendo's take on the "Space Invaders" franchise. The game is almost identical in terms of how it plays. The alien craft are arranged in rows and they slowly move left and right across the screen. When the row reaches the edge, the ships drop down a row and move in the opposite direction. As you shoot more enemies the speed will increase, as will the number of enemy bullets. You have four blocks above you that absorb the enemy shots until they are worn through, and being hit by an enemy shot will cost you a life. Sometimes a UFO will fly along the top of the screen and can be hit for Bonus points.

There are three different game modes for 1- or 2-player games :
Game A - There are two 'blocks' of aliens that move in opposite directions to each other.
Game B - The aliens move as one 'block', but they only appear one row at a time.
Game C - The same as "Space Invaders" - all the aliens move as one 'block' in the same direction.

		<name>Super Pinball Action (US) </name>
		<desc>A pinball game featuring 4 boards :
1. On the Carnival Board, there are two ways to work towards the goal : knocking out the drop targets on the upper board, or hitting the button targets that light the word 'Rhythm' on the lower part of the main board.
2. On the Border Board, the 'INPUT' button targets in the center upper part of the board are the ones to hit to work your way towards your goal.
3. On the Monster Board, you must complete 7 different target areas, each one referring to a body part : 2 roll-throughs for arms, two holes for eyes, two sets of targets for legs and the top rollovers work towards the 'head'.
4. On the Sniper Board, you knock down the 'LOAD' drop targets, then shoot the Shot Bonus button target when lit. You do this 6 times to reach your goal.

As you go follow through on the game, the warp shots let you see how far you've gone in your quest to finish each board. The fewer clothes each girl has, the further you have gone on that board. Once the women are topless, you've done all you can on that board.

		<desc>A modern and fitting tribute to Taito's 1978 seminal shoot-em-up, "Space Invaders". 

There are now 3 different game modes to choose from. These include a faithful recreation of the legendary original - available in both upright and cocktail versions - and replete with a simulation of the infamous "coloured plastic overlay" that was used to add the impression of full colour graphics to the original game.

The 2 remaining game modes are 'Versus', with simultaneous split-screen 2-player action, and "Parody", which features characters and graphics from other well-known Taito games, such as "The New Zealand Story", "Bubble Bobble" and "Liquid Kids". Despite the graphical changes, the Parody version plays identically to the original game, and all modes retain the original, legendary sound effects.

		<name>Spectar (revision 3) </name>
		<desc>Spectar, released by Exidy in 1980, is the follow-up of "Targ". Gameplay is apparently unchanged, you control a vehicle called Whummel into a 9x9 grid maze, chasing down, and being chased by, the alien invaders. Targs have evolved into the more dangerous Rammers, and Spectars appears more often, shooting at player's ship.

You use a 4-Way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at enemies. Up to 2 players can alternate in gameplay.

The most noticeable difference from his predecessors is that to complete a level you can now collect all the gems in the maze, in a "Pacman"-like game or destroy all of the Rammers (like in "Targ"). Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.

Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor : The maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environment settings, changing from the 'square-block town' of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge.

You use a 4-Way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at enemies. Up to 2 players can alternate in gameplay.

The most noticeable difference from his predecessors is that to complete a level you can now collect all the gems in the maze, in a "Pacman"-like game or destroy all of the Rammers (like in "Targ"). Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.

Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor : The maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environment settings, changing from the 'square-block town' of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge.

		<desc>In Speed Freak you drove an extremely fast car along a lonesome road. The idea was simply to drive as fast as you can without crashing. The game was time based, you could crash as much as you wanted, but points were scored for driving as fast and as far as you could without crashing. Your view of the action was from behind the hood of the car, but slightly above what an actual driver would see, kind of like you were sitting on the roof instead of inside the car. Obstacles were mainly oncoming cars (which was always the same one), and police roadblocks. The off-road scenery was limited to stick figure cows, hitchhikers, and the occasional cactus.

		<name>Super Puzzle Fighter II X (Japan 960531) </name>
		<desc>Super Puzzle Fighter II X is a puzzle game for one or two players based upon Capcom's legendary "Street Fighter" and "Vampire" series of fighting games. 

Super Puzzle Fighter II X's gameplay is reminiscent of Sega's superb 1992 puzzle game, "Puyo Puyo" with players taking on the role of one of the famous Street Fighter characters, represented visually between the two play areas in the middle of the screen. The aim is to manipulate falling coloured gem blocks, matching the colours to gems already in the play area; before finally destroying them with orbs of a like colour. 

Gems can only be eliminated by coming into contact with a 'Crash Gem' of the same colour. This eliminates all adjacent gems of that colour, setting up the potential for huge chain reactions. 

As gems are eliminated, garbage blocks called 'Counter Gems' will drop into the opponent's playfield; these will eventually become normal gems, but only after they count down to zero (most Counter Gem countdowns start at '5' and are reduced by one each time a new pair of gems is dropped on that board), until that time they cannot be eliminated by normal means. The only way to eliminate Counter Gems before they become normal gems is to place a Crash Gem of that colour nearby so it eliminates at least one normal gem. If this is done, all Counter Gems immediately adjacent to the Crash Gem will be taken out as well. 

Additionally, gems of the same colour that form squares or rectangles (of at least two blocks tall and wide) in the pit become a giant Power Gem of that size and color; eliminating these as part of a combo increases the number of Counter Gems that would otherwise normally appear on the opponent's board. 

The only other type of piece to appear is a diamond, which eliminates all the normal, Power, Counter and Crash gems of whichever colour gem it lands on. This, too, will cause Counter Gems to appear on the opponent's board. 

Whenever a player destroys a number of blocks, their on-screen Street Fighter counter-part will be shown attacking the opponent character. The fighting move used is dependent on both the colour and number of blocks the player has destroyed. 

The available in-game characters, and games from which they are taken (based on first appearance) are : 
* Ryu ("Street Fighter") 
* Ken ("Street Fighter") 
* Chun-Li ("Street Fighter II - The World Warrior") 
* Sakura ("Street Fighter Zero 2 [CP-S II No. 15]") 
* Morrigan ("Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]") 
* Donovan ("Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]") 
* Lei Lei ("Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]") 
* Felicia ("Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]") 

Hidden characters:
* Gouki ("Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge [CP-S II No. 03 Bis]") 
* Dan ("Street Fighter Zero [CP-S II No. 11]") 
* Devilotte ("Cyberbots - Fullmetal Madness [CP-S II No. 10]")

		<desc>Whoo hoo, this game is nothing but dot eating fun. You play the game one screen at a time, and each screen will be covered with dots, baddies, and will have a few logs thrown in to boot. What you are trying to do is either eat all the dots, or kill all the monsters. There are two basic kinds of enemies (plus a few more that will sometimes escort the bonus letters). The first kind is a sort of green clam, these are slow moving and pose little danger to Mr. Do. But the second kind is fairly dangerous, it is a purple cartoon snake, and it will make quick rolling attacks at Mr. Do!, you must dodge these, as your powerball is ineffective against a rolling snake. Both enemy types will sometimes transform into a purple sightless unicorn if they manage to remain alive long enough, shoot the unicorns as soon as they appear, because you cannot outrun them over long distances.

Mr. Do! has two things to defend himself with. The first is the superball, he starts out carry this, simply toss it at an enemy, and they will vanish (you can also bounce the superball off of walls for a higher score). Your superball regenerates as you eat dots and fruit, and it is often a good idea to use it as soon as it regenerates (to take out yet another baddie). Your other weapon is the logs that are scattered around the game board. Simply push them, and they will roll down the screen, taking out anything in their path (including Mr. Do! if you are dumb enough to get in their way).

You leave a line behind you as you walk, when you meet your own line (creating a box), any dots inside the box will be upgraded to cherries, while cherries upgrade to apples, which upgrade to lemons, which finally upgrade to pineapples. You don't have to do any of this fruit upgrade stuff at all, but is the best way to rack up a lot of points. You can collect letters to spell EXTRA to get a free man (just like all the other "Mr. Do!" games).

		<desc>Super Punch-Out!! is an update of the superb boxing game, "Punch-Out!!", featuring five new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'. 

As with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent. 

Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. 

Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game.

There will be four cars on the track at all times (the computer lets you know that 'Grey cars drive automatically'). Player one controls the white car, while player two (if present), controls a black car. The game will rate you at the end, you can get rated Granny, Rookie, or Pro, and getting a score over 250 points will extend the game an extra 30 seconds. The game has several different tracks available, and you can select them with a button at the start of a match. The graphics are simple black and white with two shades of gray thrown in for good measure. They are simple, but they get the job done.

Your only goal is to drive around the track as many times as possible, and as fast as you can. There will be eight cars on the track at all times. With the computer controlling cars for missing players. The sheer number of cars can make this game a little confusing. All the cars have minor variations to set them apart from the others, but are similar enough that you simply cannot look away from the track for a second. If you are used to the other Sprint games, you will find that this one is a bit different, the graphics are slightly higher in resolution, and the tracks are much more complex, and have a different look to them, not to mention the fact that this version adds a brake pedal that was absent in the other Sprint titles.

		<desc>In this game you control a race car on a semi-complicated track. You are looking down on the action from above. Your only goal is to drive around the track as many times as possible, and as fast as you can. There will be eight cars on the track at all times. With the computer controlling cars for missing players. The sheer number of cars can make this game a little confusing. All the cars have minor variations to set them apart from the others, but are similar enough that you simply cannot look away from the track for a second. If you are used to the other Sprint games, you will find that this one is a bit different, the graphics are slightly higher in resolution, and the tracks are much more complex, and have a different look to them, not to mention the fact that this version adds a brake pedal that was absent in the other Sprint titles. The game has several different tracks available, and you can select them with a button at the start of a match. The graphics are simple black and white with two shades of gray thrown in for good measure. They are simple, but they get the job done.

		<desc>Super Real Mahjong Part II is the second game in the Super Real Mahjong series.  Super Real Mahjong Part II introduces strip sequences to the game, featuring one beautifully animated opponent with six strip sequences.

Super Real Mahjong Part II begins with your female opponent taking off her sweater so she can get down to a serious game of mahjong. The tiles are mixed up, the wall is set up, the players build their hands, and the game begins. Every time the player wins a hand, his opponent strips off a piece of clothing. Every time the player loses a hand, she puts a layer of clothing back on. Should the player reveal all six strip sequences, gameplay will continue and with every win, the last strip sequence will replay. Only when the player runs out of betting funds will the game be over. The game features no continues.

		<desc>Super Real Mahjong Part IV is a strip mahjong game featuring three girls with five strip sequences each, plus 3 extra girls with one strip sequence each. Once again, the fourth game in the Super Real Mahjong series has redesigned the game tiles and from part IV on, all of the hand animations are completely removed from the game. Part IV also has greatly enhanced the quality of the animation and expanded its use in storytelling and strip sequences.

The gameplay is standard for this series.  With every winning hand the opponent removes an article of clothing. With every loss she puts a piece of clothing back on. When the player clears all a girl's strip sequences, the next girl is introduced and the game continues. The girls have unlimited betting funds so each strip sequence must be won separately. If the player loses all of his funds then the game is over.

If the player defeats all three regular opponents then the bonus game begins.  The bonus game features three extra girls with one strip sequence each. The difficulty is increased for the bonus game and once the bonus game starts there are no more continues.

		<desc>Sanrin San-Chan is a fast-moving maze-chase game in which the player takes on the role of a tricycle-pedalling child out collecting flowers, while trying to avoid collisions with the numerous enemies giving chase.

Most of the maze paths are separated into two lanes, with a springy elastic fence separating them. This fence is the key to playing the game, as players can jump into it, allowing them to squeeze past oncoming enemies in the same lane. Also, enemies on the opposite side of the fence can be sent flying from the track. Solid blocks also feature, and these can be pushed into enemies to destroy them.

Special bonus rounds feature after stages two, six, ten and fourteen. These rounds are platform-based, with the player trying to collect as many items of fruit as possible before heading up to the highest platform, to meet up with a friendly elderly lady who is waiting there. 'Fruit' and 'Happy' bonuses are then awarded.

		<name>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (Japan 930910) </name>
		<desc>The fourth game in the SFII series featured all new graphics, redone sounds, and above all, four characters new to the series. Here is a full list of changes from previous SFII games:

* New title screen with new music. 

* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison ('Vega' in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. 

* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective. 

* Vega ('Balrog' in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. 

* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male 'KO' scream). 

* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games. 

* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers. 

* Color schemes for the twelve original stage backgrounds have changed once again : 
1) Ryu stage: The sky is now near evening, and the moon is now white with a touch of light blue. 
2) E. Honda stage: The walls are now light blue, and the big picture (excluding the sun) is now red-orange. 
3) Blanka stage: The vine where the snake is coiled is now light green, and people to the right have changed a bit. The river behind the village is now a clear blue. 
4) Guile stage: The sky is back to daytime, the canopy on the jet is now clear, and the people in the background are now dressed in blue. The symbol on the ground is back to blue, but the missile linings are still red. 
5) Ken stage: The tugboat has been replaced with a yacht, the two guys on the top now wear orange clothes and white clothes. On the bottom, the first person now wears a green shirt and has gray hair, the second person now wears white t-shirt and yellow pants, the third person now has long hair and wears white top and pink skirt, the fourth person now wears light blue shirt and orange pants, and the guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now replaced by a new person in blue shirt and navy blue pants.
6) Chun Li stage: The sky is now sunset, the two customers now wear orange, the meat store's roof is now green with its sign back to red, the guy holding the chicken now wears blue, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" sign is now red-orange with yellow letters, the guy to the right now wears green pants, and the water sign is now blue.
7) Zangief stage: The stage floor is now green, and the area to the left is back to red. In addition, the fence on the left foreground is now lowered a bit. 
8) Dhalsim stage: The curtains and stone floor are now green, and the carpet is back to red. 
9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage: While the stage floor is still purple, the 'Las Vegas' on the floor is now yellow. The car to the left is now blue, and the car to the right is now green.

		<name>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (Japan 930911) </name>
		<desc>The fourth game in the SFII series featured all new graphics, redone sounds, and above all, four characters new to the series. Here is a full list of changes from previous SFII games:

* New title screen with new music. 

* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison ('Vega' in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. 

* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective. 

* Vega ('Balrog' in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. 

* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male 'KO' scream). 

* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games. 

* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers. 

* Color schemes for the twelve original stage backgrounds have changed once again : 
1) Ryu stage: The sky is now near evening, and the moon is now white with a touch of light blue. 
2) E. Honda stage: The walls are now light blue, and the big picture (excluding the sun) is now red-orange. 
3) Blanka stage: The vine where the snake is coiled is now light green, and people to the right have changed a bit. The river behind the village is now a clear blue. 
4) Guile stage: The sky is back to daytime, the canopy on the jet is now clear, and the people in the background are now dressed in blue. The symbol on the ground is back to blue, but the missile linings are still red. 
5) Ken stage: The tugboat has been replaced with a yacht, the two guys on the top now wear orange clothes and white clothes. On the bottom, the first person now wears a green shirt and has gray hair, the second person now wears white t-shirt and yellow pants, the third person now has long hair and wears white top and pink skirt, the fourth person now wears light blue shirt and orange pants, and the guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now replaced by a new person in blue shirt and navy blue pants.
6) Chun Li stage: The sky is now sunset, the two customers now wear orange, the meat store's roof is now green with its sign back to red, the guy holding the chicken now wears blue, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" sign is now red-orange with yellow letters, the guy to the right now wears green pants, and the water sign is now blue.
7) Zangief stage: The stage floor is now green, and the area to the left is back to red. In addition, the fence on the left foreground is now lowered a bit. 
8) Dhalsim stage: The curtains and stone floor are now green, and the carpet is back to red. 
9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage: While the stage floor is still purple, the 'Las Vegas' on the floor is now yellow. The car to the left is now blue, and the car to the right is now green. The guy throwing the confetti at win/lose now wears yellow, the guy next to the car to the left now wears purple and the guy next to the guy throwing the confetti has been redesigned.
10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage: The stage floor now shows off a green hue, and the fence now comes crashing down at the start of the fight. 
11) Sagat stage: Buddhist statue is still gold, and now it's sunset. In addition, a big city is now visible in the distance. 
12) M. Bison ([JP] Vega) stage: The sky is now back to daytime, and the guys sitting Indian style praying (and stands up angrily after breaking a big statue) are now dark-skinned. The roof of the palace is now red with green trim, and the linings on the giant bell that were previously red are now black.

		<desc>Here is a list of changes from "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" : 
* Modified title screen with new music. 
* The 'Character Select' screen's background music is changed. The new song is based on the title screen theme of the CPS1 SFII games. 
* After each character's ending, a new piece of artwork is displayed for that character. In Ryu's new art, the kanji 'Fuurinkazan' are written on his belt. These are the same kanji that are displayed on the breakable signs in Ryu's stage in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" and "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". 
* New artwork in Dhalsim's ending. The picture of Dhalsim and his son is replaced with a new picture of Dhalsim with his wife and son. The photograph on the wall now shows Dhalsim with Sagat and Vega (It used to show two generic guys). 
* All bonus games have been removed.

You control your car through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the car, or cars, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.

Space Attack is another game inspired by "Space Invaders". This one is a more straightforward version, although after you finish off a rack a UFO starts working its way down; shoot it and you'll get a bonus (and maybe a free ship).

		<name>Star Castle (version 3) </name>
		<desc>You and other experienced intergalactic voyagers have heard about and shared the legend of Star Castle -- a mysterious fortress in a far away galaxy filled with incredible riches and surrounded by revolving walls of shimmering solid gold. Yet no one, until now, has ever actually seen the Castle -- or lived to tell about it!

As you approach, you are overwhelmed with the beauty of the Castle but you suddenly realize that the golden walls hide a deadly arsenal. To survive you must destroy the walls and the powerful Energy Cannon they shield. Perhaps you will be the first to survive the Star Castle's arsenal and prove the legend true. Perhaps not!

		<desc>Star Castle is a 1- or 2-player outer space action game designed with features geared for maximum player appeal : A progressively difficult competitive level and a clearly defined enemy which must be both attacked and avoided at various points in the course of play.

The center of the playfield is occupied by the Star Castle which is programmed to constantly home in on the players' ships. Surrounding the Star Castle are three concentric energy rings of twelve segments each, which serve as both a protective perimeter for the Star Castle and a source of points for the player. Contained within the energy rings are three protective mines which seek out the players' ships and destroy them upon collision. The movements of the mines are programmed to simulate the actions of heat-seeking missiles.

The object of the games of Star Castle is to score the maximum number of points possible. This is accomplished by the combination of three elements :
a) Exploding the ring segments.
b) Exploding the Star Castle.
c) Avoiding the Star Castle's mines. A player's turn is over when his ship has been destroyed. The number of ships per game is set by the operator.

For maximum scoring, a player will want to shoot out sections of the energy rings in order to give him a shot at the Star Castle in the center of the screen. As play progresses, there are 2 facts a player must keep in mind :
1) Exploding all segments in a given ring will cause the entire ring to reappear - thereby eliminating a potential shot at the Star Castle in the center.
2) Exploding the rings in a manner that gives you a shot at the Star Castle will also give the Star Castle a shot at you. The Star Castle is programmed so that its nose always seeks out the player's ship. If there is an open shot at the player, it will take it.

When the Star Castle is hit by a player's missile, it will first implode and then explode with all remaining ring segments. After a one-second delay, the Star Castle will reappear with all three ring segments. If the Star Castle shoots the player, his turn is over.

As play begins, the Star Castle will appear in the center of the screen surrounded by its 3 energy rings. The player's ship appears about halfway up on the right hand edge. By using the control buttons to move forward, right or left, the player maneuvers about the screen using the firing button to launch missiles.

Points are scored by destroying the energy ring segments or the Star Castle itself. Exploding the Star Castle gives an extra ship as well as points. No points are given for the mines that attack the player.

The player's ship can be destroyed in 2 ways : By collision with the mines or by a hit from the Star Castle's torpedo. The mines are launched from the rings and attack the player for approximately ten seconds or until shot. The Star Castle's torpedoes are launched only when there is a clear shot at the player through all 3 rings. At this time the player also has his shot at the Star Castle. Both the Star Castle and the mines get smarter and faster as the game progresses.

The game of STAR CASTLE is not based on time units. The battle rages on until all the players' ships are destroyed. The length of the game depends solely on the skill of the player. It's the age-old challenge of man versus machine.

Special symbols appear at regular intervals and can be shot or collected for bonuses and power-ups. Each level has an end-of-level boss that must be defeated before the player can progress to the next level, while the levels themselves are designated by letters of the Greek alphabet.

		<desc>The galaxy is under threat from a malevolent race of cyborgs. Half animal, half machine, the cyborgs have already conquered most of the galaxy and now have their sights set on the galaxy's last hope, 'The Planet of the Golden Dragon'. A lone mechanoid dragon, unhappy with the actions of his comrades, rebels and sets out to thwart their invasion of the Planet of the Golden Dragon.

Saint Dragon is a demanding and playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up, played over six different stages. The tail of the mechanoid dragon the player controls is impervious to enemy attacks and causes damage to any enemy it touches. The head of the dragon is effectively the 'ship' of the game and a direct hit from an enemy will result in the loss of a life.

At various points in a stage bronze-coloured eggs appear which, when shot, release weapon and speed power-ups.

1st Level : Defend against rotating cannons.
2nd Level : Watch out for attacking Jeeps
3rd Level : Careful! Here come attacking and shooting tanks
4th Level : Rotating cannons again, but this time against a moving background.

An audible signal warns that it's refueling time. Enter a fuel dock and receive 100-300 points. The Tank commander's life isn't an easy one.

Aside from an on-going battle, he has to watch out for obstacles and rough terrain. Brick walls destroy tanks, although they can be shot away. TNT, rather nasty stuff...explodes when shot, but destroys all objects in the area. Stay off pink backgrounds. That's where the land mines are buried. They explode only on contact. Don't worry about a blue background, though. It's a slip zone like an oil slick and can be driven across. If an alien base is found and destroyed, advance to the next level of difficulty. You bet there's a 'buy-in' feature on this one.

Strategy X. There's never been a war game like it. It blows minds, and quarters.

		<desc>You begin by choosing one of 2 fighters (either a blond guy, or a dark haired guy in karate gear). Then you are whisked away to one of many cities on the map to have a battle. The opponents are tough, but simple. This game has no special moves (and has only punch, kick, and jump buttons), and all characters have insanely high energy. So you pretty much just wail away at each other with punches and kicks until someone falls down. An ambulance will show up to haul away your defeated opponent, and a girl in the audience will come out to congratulate you

		<desc>Saurian lizard men have overrun all twenty-two planets that form the New Earth Solar System colonies, capturing and mutating the resident human colonies into reptiles to use as slave labour at their stronghold base, the Saurian Mega-Star Apocalypse

In the 3rd game in Midway's seminal "Defender" series, Strikeforce again has the player flying a spaceship over the surface of a series of two-way, horizontally scrolling planets, destroying enemy waves and rescuing humans from the alien invaders; with rescued humans hanging from the underside of the player's ship. Once these tasks have been completed, the mothership arrives to pick up the player's ship, together with any humans they have rescued. Players can decide which planets to attack, when to purchase additional firepower and when to attack the Apocalypse.

Strikeforce's graphics differ from the minimalist, stylish appearance of the first two games in the series; with full colour sprites, multi-layer scrolling and colourful, visceral explosions giving the game its own distinctive look and feel.

		<desc>Take a seat, grasp the controls, and enter the world of the S.T.U.N. (Spread Tunnel Underground Network) Runner. Players travel ahead in time to the 21st century and experience the thrill of racing in a futuristic form of competitive driving. At the control of state-of-the-art technology, players pilot a billion-dollar vehicle capable of attaining speeds of over 900 miles per hour!

Players control their vehicles with a return-to-center (RTC) flight controller. Control handles adjust shot elevation and include trigger buttons for firing. The start button is also used as a fire button for 'shock waves'.

S.T.U.N. runner is a game of speed. The goal of this game is to travel as fast as possible and complete each race within the allotted time. Numerous enemies prevent the player from achieving this goal. Equipped with powerful lasers, all enemies can be gunned down with the exception of one.

The race through the S.T.U.N. Network is made up of many levels. Each level presents a unique challenge to the player. The player's ultimate goal is to guide the vehicle through the network of levels to reach the 'Ultimate Challenge'. In this never-ending race, players go as far as their driving skills will take them. If the distance they travel qualifies as one of the top five, their name (18 letters) will be displayed along the road for future players to see (only if they reach this distance).

In S.T.U.N. Runner, there is no foot pedal to control speed. Faster speed is achieved by :
* Correctly driving on the fastest portion of the tunnel.
* Staying off side rails (of flat sections).
* Avoiding collisions with enemy vehicles.
* Running over 'boosts' for hyperspeed.
* Avoiding areas under construction.

In turn, the fastest portion of the tunnel is the outer wall. Like a luge or bobsled racer, players use basic laws of physics to attain the fastest speed.  Riding on the inner wall results in a slower speed and hinders a player's ability to reach a finish line. On flat sections, running into side rails creates a visual and audio chattering resulting in a loss of speed. The first race, a training race, called 'Cake Walk', is intended to teach players how to drive correctly.

Red flashing markers in tunnels and flats are called 'boosts'. By running over these, the S.T.U.N. Runner gets a boost of hyperspeed. In addition to reaching the finish line faster, a S.T.U.N. Runner in boost in invincible. The vehicle can pass through all enemy vehicles unharmed and cannot be shot. In this mode the player's vehicle will appear transparent as though it is a skeleton.

The underground network has three different tunnel sections. They include wide tunnels, narrow tunnels, and tunnels under construction. Under construction sections contain portions that are unsurfaced. These areas do not provide full power to the vehicle, and slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner.

Open areas are called 'flats' and are both narrow and wide. Being above the ground, the player is treated to many views of the earth's surface in the 21st century. On flats, players must avoid driving along the side rails. The friction caused will slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle.

A S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle has six shields for added protection. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of one shield. At the end of each race, players are awarded bonus points for each shield remaining. A large bonus is awarded if all shields are intact.

In the tunnels and flats are ramps. These ramps will catapult S.T.U.N. Runners above the track for a brief distance. Ramp jumping is often a good method of crossing areas under construction and avoiding collisions with enemies.

When players do not reach the finish line of a race within the allotted time, the game would normally end. However, they can be allowed to advance to the next level on a continuation.

Special Weapon : In selected races, a 'shock wave' is located along the way.  If the player can pick up the shock wave, the weapon becomes available for use. Also, shock waves can be awarded on some levels if the player hits a predetermined number of stars and completes the level. This information is green in the map at the start of each level.

Players activate the shock wave by pressing the start button. This super weapon will destroy all enemies and hazards within view. It is a one-time weapon, but more than one can be stored. The number of shock waves stored is show as blue and white icons on the screen below the level number display.

Bonus Stars : Additional points can be scored along the way by running over 'stars'. In the first race, the training race called 'Cake Walk', the stars are red. Players should run over as many stars as possible. In the remainder of the game, all bonus stars are green.

Challenge Races : These are bonus races awarded to players for reaching various points in the game. Races 5, 10, and 15 are challenge races. Each presents a unique challenge to the player.
* Boost Challenge
* Star Challenge
* Kill Challenge

In each challenge race, players have one goal. Instructions are displayed prior to the start of each race. The time clock still operates, but a game will not end because the time expires. This is considered a free bonus for players. Each challenge level has its own high score table.

Ultimate Challenge : For those players skilful and patient enough, an 'Ultimate Challenge' awaits them at the end. It is an endless race filled with enemies and unexpected surprises. The object is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time. Markers on the road display the names of the five best S.T.U.N. Runners. It is a unique method of identifying the best players of the game. These names are also presented on a separate high score table.

		<desc>Take a seat, grasp the controls, and enter the world of the S.T.U.N. (Spread Tunnel Underground Network) Runner. Players travel ahead in time to the 21st century and experience the thrill of racing in a futuristic form of competitive driving. At the control of state-of-the-art technology, players pilot a billion-dollar vehicle capable of attaining speeds of over 900 miles per hour!

Players control their vehicles with a return-to-center (RTC) flight controller. Control handles adjust shot elevation and include trigger buttons for firing. The start button is also used as a fire button for 'shock waves'.

S.T.U.N. runner is a game of speed. The goal of this game is to travel as fast as possible and complete each race within the allotted time. Numerous enemies prevent the player from achieving this goal. Equipped with powerful lasers, all enemies can be gunned down with the exception of one.

The race through the S.T.U.N. Network is made up of many levels. Each level presents a unique challenge to the player. The player's ultimate goal is to guide the vehicle through the network of levels to reach the 'Ultimate Challenge'. In this never-ending race, players go as far as their driving skills will take them. If the distance they travel qualifies as one of the top five, their name (18 letters) will be displayed along the road for future players to see (only if they reach this distance).

In S.T.U.N. Runner, there is no foot pedal to control speed. Faster speed is achieved by :
* Correctly driving on the fastest portion of the tunnel.
* Staying off side rails (of flat sections).
* Avoiding collisions with enemy vehicles.
* Running over 'boosts' for hyperspeed.
* Avoiding areas under construction.

In turn, the fastest portion of the tunnel is the outer wall. Like a luge or bobsled racer, players use basic laws of physics to attain the fastest speed.  Riding on the inner wall results in a slower speed and hinders a player's ability to reach a finish line. On flat sections, running into side rails creates a visual and audio chattering resulting in a loss of speed. The first race, a training race, called 'Cake Walk', is intended to teach players how to drive correctly.

Red flashing markers in tunnels and flats are called 'boosts'. By running over these, the S.T.U.N. Runner gets a boost of hyperspeed. In addition to reaching the finish line faster, a S.T.U.N. Runner in boost in invincible. The vehicle can pass through all enemy vehicles unharmed and cannot be shot. In this mode the player's vehicle will appear transparent as though it is a skeleton.

The underground network has three different tunnel sections. They include wide tunnels, narrow tunnels, and tunnels under construction. Under construction sections contain portions that are unsurfaced. These areas do not provide full power to the vehicle, and slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner.

Open areas are called 'flats' and are both narrow and wide. Being above the ground, the player is treated to many views of the earth's surface in the 21st century. On flats, players must avoid driving along the side rails. The friction caused will slow down the S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle.

A S.T.U.N. Runner vehicle has six shields for added protection. Colliding with an enemy results in the loss of one shield. At the end of each race, players are awarded bonus points for each shield remaining. A large bonus is awarded if all shields are intact.

In the tunnels and flats are ramps. These ramps will catapult S.T.U.N. Runners above the track for a brief distance. Ramp jumping is often a good method of crossing areas under construction and avoiding collisions with enemies.

When players do not reach the finish line of a race within the allotted time, the game would normally end. However, they can be allowed to advance to the next level on a continuation.

Special Weapon : In selected races, a 'shock wave' is located along the way.  If the player can pick up the shock wave, the weapon becomes available for use. Also, shock waves can be awarded on some levels if the player hits a predetermined number of stars and completes the level. This information is green in the map at the start of each level.

Players activate the shock wave by pressing the start button. This super weapon will destroy all enemies and hazards within view. It is a one-time weapon, but more than one can be stored. The number of shock waves stored is show as blue and white icons on the screen below the level number display.

Ultimate Challenge : For those players skilful and patient enough, an 'Ultimate Challenge' awaits them at the end. It is an endless race filled with enemies and unexpected surprises. The object is to travel as far as possible within the allotted time. Markers on the road display the names of the five best S.T.U.N. Runners. It is a unique method of identifying the best players of the game. These names are also presented on a separate high score table.

		<name>Subroc-3D </name>
		<desc>SUBROC-3D is an overwhelming 3-dimensional game, with a dual scene system for battles in the ocean or in space. The graphics and sound effects are very exciting!

You command a sophisticated craft and by using the elevation controls you can move it up or down so it can be operated under water or in space.

The periscope-type viewer can be moved from side to side, enabling you to attack more enemies.

Preen the fire button to shoot down the enemy.

The dynamic stereo sound system creates an amazingly realistic surround effect.

Many strangely-shaped crafts, missiles and UFOs suddenly zoom in to attack you; once they are in your sights they can attack you, so shoot first and survive!

The 3-dimensional effect of fast-moving crafts and missiles, combined with the terrifying  explosions seemingly right up close to you are truly bewildering.

To destroy the BARRIER guarding the enemy COMMAND SHIP, you must hit it in the very center.

After blowing up the COMMAND SHIP, you proceed to another round.

The bonus points remaining will be added to your score.

When you reach HIGH SCORE you will get another ship.

In each successive round the score increases by 100 points over the previous round.

Your score and the round are displayed at the top of the screen. Your score and the previous best three scores are displayed over the periscope.

Play ends with the loss of your last ship.

You're not exactly helpless, though. You have balloon bombs which you can lay and detonate, rocks on top of the house to drop, floors that move across when you step on them and pools of water under bridges which you open by walking over them. All these can kill cats and cobras, if you use them right.

		<desc>Super Xevious Gump no Nazo is a vertical shooter by Namco. Interestingly, this is a Famicom exclusive sequel to Xevious and not a port of the arcade game of the same name released in 1984. "GAMP no Nazo" translates as "GAMP's mystery" and this is where the game greatly differs from other Xevious games. The essential task of each stage is for the player to fulfill a certain condition. Each one of the sixteen levels just loops until the condition is fully satisfied and each area features a different puzzle to solve. The objectives vary from finding the stage's hidden exist to destroying all the objects of a particular kind. The player takes control of the Solvalou and can shoot ahead and drop bombs in the classic Xevious tradition. However, Super Xevious now features power-ups. A small spaceship appears in almost every stage and drops colored power-capsules - the black ones activate a rotating shield, the yellow ones equip a large bomb-target and then the blue ones allows the ship to also fire backward.

		<name>Tac/Scan </name>
		<desc>Tac/Scan is a 1 or 2-player alternate action game, displayed via Sega's Color X-Y video system. Commanding unprecedented firepower, the player maneuvers seven fighter ships in a squadron formation. All seven ships fire at once when the Fire button is pressed, producing a spectacular missile salvo.

The object of the game is to accumulate points by destroying incoming enemy ships while dodging fireballs launched by these enemies. Tac/Scan presents the space battle from two entirely different perspective views in the course of the game, with visually exciting transition sequences interconnecting the two views.

The player begins the game with a seven-ship formation, and a supply of reserve ships which are shown above the player score on the screen. The number of reserve ships at the beginning of the game is switch selectable. An Add Ship button placed next to the Fire button transfers one of the reserve ships in the squadron formation. Where the reserve ships are placed is shown by a half-intensity fighter in the formation. This 'add ship' position continuously cycles between the empty squadron positions, and the advanced player will time the Add Ship function to place squadron fighters at preferred positions.

A player fighter is blown up by contact with either an enemy ship or an enemy fireball. Whenever all seven ship positions become empty the game is over, even if there are remaining reserve fighters shown above the player score. Thus the player must continuously judge when to add reserve fighters by using the Add Ship button. Add them too early, and they might be depleted too fast; use them too late and you risk ending the game with reserve fighters left over.

There is an additional way to add ships to the squadron. During the course of the action, player fighter ships enter the playfield and intermix with the enemy ships. The player can capture these fighters directly into the seven ship formation by steering them into empty fighter positions. The player's missile fire does not blow up friendly fighters--only enemy ships.

Tac/Scan begins with a top view of the battle. For the first ten seconds the player shoots at enemy ships without having to worry about return fire. After this 'warm-up' period, game play escalates dramatically. During this first phase, a different type of enemy appears just after two of the player fighters fly onto the screen. This is the Stinger, which flits around the field and shoots a deadly laser. This ship is a high priority target, since if not dealt with, it will pick off all of the squadron ships and end the game.

When the player attempts to dock a friendly fighter into the squadron formation, he or she has the choice of any of the empty ship positions shown in the squadron. A special feature occurs when the player ship docks into the front-most ship position (marked with a red 'cursor'). Thin causes the squadron formation to regroup into a different pattern. If the load position is occupied, a fighter is added to the reserve count above the player's score.

At the end of the first phase (the top view) the squadron ships regroup, and a dramatic transition sequence takes the player into phase two. This sequence consists of the fighters rising and enlarging in size, then turning into the screen, lighting afterburners, and proceeding to fly forward to continue the battle. The enemy ships now appear far off in the distance, and grow in size as they approach the player's squadron. The player is given chances to rendezvous with friendly fighters, as in phase one.

At the end of this second phase, a space tunnel appears on the screen, and the player uses the rotary control to steer the squadron formation through the tunnel. Any fighter which hits a side wall of the tunnel explodes on contact. A triangular guide is shown during this sequence to show the player where his triangular ship formation should be. If the player keeps the formation centered within the guide, no ships will be lost.

Once out of the space tunnel, the player resumes with the second round. This is a more difficult top view battle, as at the beginning of the game. Tac/Scan proceeds with multiple two-phase rounds (phase one is the top view, phase two is the rear view) until all squadron ships are lost.

A switch option allows bonus reserve chips to he added with certain score values. The factory set option is to add one reserve ship every 30,000 points.

Regardless of the number of squadron ships on the screen, there are always seven missiles at a time available to the player. If there are seven ships on the screen (a full squadron), pressing the Fire button launches all seven at once. Another push of the Fire button cancels the seven in flight and launches seven new ones. If the squadron is not full, the seven missiles can be independently targeted. For example, with a single ship, seven missiles can be fired in seven directions, and only when the eighth is shot is the first one terminated (if it is still on the screen).

The 2-player game is played with players alternating after successful negotiation of the space tunnel. Whenever a player is eliminated, the other player continues and finishes the game.

When all enemies are destroyed, you are awarded an extra bonus and can access the following level. 2 players can alternate in the game. You use a 4-way joystick to control the Wummel, and a pushbutton to fire at enemies. Progressing in the gameplay causes the Targs to become faster and smarter, for a fast and furious gameplay.

		<desc>25,000 bonus docked. The 'carrot' had become a big baseball bat we were beaten with almost daily. One guy walked out after having his bonus docked for coming in at noon, and he quit on the spot. The next day he was placated and he came back. I remember this moment vividly--working away at 3:30 a.m. one morning. I was so physically exhausted that I casually leaned over to the garbage can and vomited, after which I went right back to tapping away. My fingers never left the keyboard.".

"Our biggest deadline was the ACME convention. We made it there with a game that played, but there were no special moves for any characters except for one electric zap thrown in for A. C. Current just before we got on the plane. The game was a joke but no one seemed to notice--we were congratulated at having made it that far, which was impressive only if you knew the whole story. One guy at the show made a point over and over again that he could get through the entire game start to finish by pounding the electric zap button over and over with one finger. I wanted to beat him senseless.".

"The biggest problem at this point was that we were all completely burned out. We knew the game was crap, and that we were no longer capable of fixing it. After we got back from the show, we were so "crispy" that we no longer cared about the money--our only true reward for finishing up was that we wouldn't have to work on it any more. The artwork looked pretty bad because it had all been a rush job to make the show. This was an incredible shame because the artists were so talented, but their talent were being scuttled in dealing with the crappy video source. New artists were brought on to help pitch in, but it was too little too late.".

"New games like "Primal Rage" and "Killer Instinct" came out, and they blew Tattoo Assassins away. We resisted violently any attempt to change the game to make it better, because that would mean we would be working on it longer -- I've since read about this attitude being common in projects where coders are placed under very high pressure. The artists were hoping that the programmers would come up with some new game play feature to make the game sell, regardless of the quality of the graphics, whereas programmers were hoping that the ARTISTS would miraculously 'beautify' things so that the game would sell regardless of the game play. One programmer actually stopped working almost entirely in the hopes of getting fired -- he had signed a three year contract and would have to be paid off in a huge way if he got fired. He wanted out anyway to go get married and start up his own dot-com.".

"Karla Keller was never going to be "Nancy", although that was who she was obviously modeled after. Lyla Blue was indeed Slash's wife. TA was actually developed within Data East Pinball in Chicago, IL. We had a working relationship with Slash because of the Guns and Roses pinball we created. His wife is a professional model.".

"I remember our testers. One of them posted some really scathing stuff to Usenet. We had several of our competitors' games in the lab with our TAs, and we'd have to go down to the lab every half hour to stop them playing pinball and make them go back to playing our game. We couldn't even PAY people to play TA it seems :)".

Real Life : Gretchen Stockdale (Hannah Hart) gave up modeling and became a fully qualified attorney.

Carlos and Daniel Pesina from Midway's MK series worked in Tattoo Assassins. After that, Midway didn't want them to work with them in "Mortal Kombat 3", so they killed Johnny Cage (the only Daniel Pesina character that didn't wear a mask) and excluded Raiden (Carlos Pesina).

Maurice Travis (as A.C. Current in TA) became World Champion muay thai fighter just starred in Hong Fight film called The Champion. Won The Superbrawl extreme fighting Championships in Hawaii. Maurice character Zolar Become a kids WB 2 hour movie (The first live action at the KIDSWB).

Note : The game claims there are 220 fatalities (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info).

TA is the only Fighting game where you can kick while you block. And it's also the only Fighting game where you see a man undressing to fart, and a woman farts too...

The DeLorean DMC-12 which appears in the Hit and Stay fatality is a nod to co-creator Bob Gale (who worked on the 'Back to The Future' trilogy).

		<desc>A strange and unique platform game by Sega. Guide Teddy Boy through an ever scrolling maze to defeat ninjas, snails, big mouthed hippos and other bizarre creatures.

You shoot your enemies with a gun that shrinks them - then you must collect your shrunken foes for bonus points. If you don't collect them quick enough, they will fly down to the bottom of the screen and eat a portion of your time meter.

Occasionally you will get a chance to play a bonus game as Teddy Boy or Yohko Ishino. A target shooting game can be played as Teddy, and as Yohko, you can enjoy a short treasure hunting game.

		<desc>2,295. 25,113 Upright units were produced. Tempest sold approximately 20,000 units to distributors before it was even released. 

Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. It is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace. 

Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. Tempest was originally a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone called 'Vortex', but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit. 

The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around. 

* The Creation of Tempest : Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different. 

Rich Adam : "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game... and he said to himself : 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.". 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. 

Dave Theurer : "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.". 

Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. 

Dan Pliskin : "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.". 

* Popular from the Start : Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. 

Lyle Rains : "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things". 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Not only did players often find a sense of welcome escape in the video games they played, but this was very much the intention of some of the great game designers. 

Dave Theurer : "I want to design it for a guy who's totally frazzled by his job and needs a way to temporarily escape. There's a certain class of games... where you just get into a trance when you're playing them. As long as you're in this trance you'll do fine." 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TEMPEST. 

A Tempest unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Twilight Zone - The Movie', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' (A cocktail cabinet) and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'. 

A Tempest unit appears in the music video 'Subdivisions' by RUSH. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

		<name>Terra Cresta (YM3526 set 1) </name>
		<desc>Terra Cresta is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set over a constantly scrolling landscape of islands and enemy installations. The player is under constant attack from enemy spaceship waves, ground-based guns and turrets, dinosaurs and three different mothercraft ships. 

The levels are littered with ground-based silos bearing numbers between 2 and 5. These can be shot to release a player ship component, which then attaches to the player's current ship, increasing both its size and firepower. Power-ups available are 2-Wide shot, 3-Rear Shot, 4-Front cannon and 5-Rear shield. 

Using the 'Formation' button splits the ship parts into a formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation. For example, if the player has picked up two ship parts then a triangle is formed, with the player's main ship at the rear of the formation, with additional two ship components positioned at the front edge of the triangle. 

When all four numbered parts have been collected, the player's ship transforms into a flaming Phoenix, and is indestructible for a limited time.

		<desc>You control one or two boats floating along the high seas. The boats are armed with depth charges for dropping on the aquatic wildlife and submarines in the depth far below. Homing torpedoes, Polaris missiles, mines, Stingray style vessels and other boat-wrecking hazards make up the threats to avoid or destroy. Bonus capsules which float up to the surface boost the boat's speed, increase depth charge power, give the player temporary invincibility and other normal features but of a marine vein. The depth charges take their time to float to their target so plan ahead using the map, submarines at different heights in the water pose further problems. This game also has good backgrounds.

		<desc>This title plays a lot like "Pac-Man", except the maze is more detailed. You drive you car around the maze, picking up the money that is laying around everywhere (just like the dots in "Pac-Man"). Now to avoid being any more like" Pac-Man", the designer decided to give you four enemies, who each move around the maze with a distinct personality (but they are cars, not ghosts). In a final attempt to make this game different from "Pac-man", the designer then added dollar signs in each corner of the screen, running over these allows you to chase after your foes, and run over them (not at all like "Pac-Man"). In later levels these dollar signs may be in places other than the corners (finally, something that actually is different than "Pac-Man"). Each level is finished by clearing all the dollars bills from the board (the game will also rate you with a new 'Crime Level' every time you complete a screen).

		<name>Thunder Blade (upright, FD1094 317-0056) </name>
		<desc>Taking control of a heavily-armed battle chopper, the player must battle through a variety of both overhead and 'into-the-screen' 3-D stages.

Each stage is packed with a mixture of enemy choppers, planes, tanks, boats and static gun emplacements, all intent on bringing Thunder Blade crashing to the ground.

The player's 'copter is armed with 2 different weapons; a rapid-fire machine gun and air-to-ground missiles - both of which have unlimited ammunition.

The first half of every stage begins with a top-down, vertically-scrolling section, before switching to an 'After Burner-esque', into-the-screen section.

Thunder Blade consists of four stages, which are as follows :
* Stage 1 : The game begins in a skyscraper-packed city. Enemies consist of rival choppers, jets, and ground-based tanks and gun emplacements. The level ends over the sea, with the player facing a huge and heavily-armed battleship. 
* Stage 2 : This stage begins with the player navigating a desert canyon, before switching to the into-the-screen view and taking the player through a number of stalactite-packed and densely populated caves. A huge ground-based tank awaits the player at the end of the stage.
* Stage 3 : This begins in a river canyon, before moving on to a rain-forest river network. As well the the usual line-up of enemies, heavily-armed boats are introduced. the end-of-level battle takes place in the skies as the player attempts to destroy a massive jet fighter.
* Stage 4 : The 4th and final stage begins with a repeat of the first stage's city level, only this time the action takes place at night. The second half of this stage takes the player deep into an industrial complex, eventually leading to an end-of-game showdown with a massive and heavily-armed gun emplacement.

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Japan 2 Players) </name>
		<desc>A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either 'Leonardo' (blue, katana blades), 'Raphael' (red, sais), 'Michaelangelo' (orange, nunchakas) or 'Donatello' (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to try and rescue 'April O'Neil' and 'Splinter', before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies 'Krang' and 'The Shredder'.

Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for 'Jump' and 'Attack' - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a 'buy-in' option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.

But one day, a gigantic leopard seal appears from nowhere and stuffs all the poor birds in his giant bag to sell them on the black market. Tiki manages to escape his captor and decides to help his friends. But our hero is not your traditional Kiwi - He comes equipped with a bow and arrows and special items can get him to throw bombs, fire lasers and even steal and ride his opponents' flying vehicles. Stages are vast and warp-doors scattered around them help our Kiwi friend in his long journey.

Toobin' was a classic example of Atari's genius approach to abstract game design, that would typify their heyday of the mid-to-late 80s.

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TOOBIN.

Special Contest Feature : Every Toobin' game in the U.S. has a special contest. A player can win a free Toobin' t-shirt just for playing the game and finding and picking up all seven characters to spell the word Toobin' (including the apostrophe). These characters are hidden in the river below obstacles and hazards. The letters collected by the player are shown at the beach party at the end of the run. For more contest details, see the game (The offer expired December 1, 1988).

		<name>Top Secret (Japan, old revision) </name>
		<desc>Top Secret is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set ten years after the end of World War III, with the player taking on the role of 'Super Joe'; an elite Commando tasked with infiltrating the enemy's heavily defended military base to discover their secrets plans and destroy their missile silos. 

To aid him in his mission, Joe is equipped with a bionic arm; a telescopic grappling hook that is used to traverse the many platforms and ledges that make up the game's levels. The arm can also be used to temporarily stun enemies or knock them from platforms, as well as to retrieve the bonus items, wooden crates and weapons that are occasionally dropped into the war zone by parachute. 

As well as the bionic arm, Joe is armed with a shotgun used to kill enemies and destroy obstructions. The shotgun can only be fired left and right, however, and cannot be used at the same time as the bionic arm. More powerful guns can be picked up throughout the game. 

Bionic Commando consists of five stages: 
* Stage 1: Forest 
* Stage 2: Enemy Outpost (The Forefront) 
* Stage 3: Underground Base (Infiltration) 
* Stage 4: Control Tower 
* Stage 5: Stop the Missile 

In the final level, Joe must stop a nuclear missile from launching, before a final confrontation with the game's final boss, the leader of the enemy forces.

		<name>Tora e no Michi (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Tora-he no Michi is a side scrolling action game by Capcom and conversion of the arcade game of the same name. Lee Wong is a young monk and a student of the Oh-Lin school of martial arts. He's also a master of the legendary Oh-Lin Tiger techniques. One day, the warriors of the Dragon God went to rob the four secret scrolls from the Oh-Lin temple and kidnapped all the children from the village. The bald and axe-swinging monk doesn't have much choice; he must now go through five long areas, and save the children and reclaim the Oh-Lin scrolls. Lee comes equipped with an axe - a weapon of limited range and accuracy. However, more weapons can be collected along the way by cracking open treasure chests and statues. The two other available weapons are the Mace (weak but covers a large area) and the Spear (fast but short range). Other special items are also available for the taking - Health Bottles, Invincibility Crystal Balls, Lives, keys (to unlock special doors) or Capcom's trademark POW icon which upgrades Lee's current weapon. Each area is divided into sub-levels and some even branch out and allow players to fight different bosses. Interestingly, each area ends with a small training session where the monk can improve his fighting skills and techniques. There, Lee can gain extra health or learn a new and powerful Tiger Attack. The monk has few more tricks up his sleeves and parts of the game feature vertical-scrolling flying stages. Finally, Tora-he no Michi has a save feature and allows the player to continue from the last visited sub-stage, but a device with built-in backup RAM is necessary (such as a CD-ROM unit or a Tennokoe 2 Bank).

		<desc>The game is a very simple game of baseball, implemented with stick figures. The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a 'swing' button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.

1 or 2 players must fight through the enemy-packed levels, rescuing reporters and civilians as they go. Total Carnage retains the dual-joystick control of its predecessor, but introduced new weapons, enemies and large, scrolling levels to the original game-play.

As with "Smash TV", Total Carnage features the infamous 'Pleasuredome'; accessible only if players manage to collect the 220 keys that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Total Carnage has a much higher difficulty level than that of "Smash TV".

		<desc>Time Pilot '84 is an eight-way scrolling shoot 'em up and is the sequel to 1982's 'Time Pilot'. As with the prequel, the game's stages are set over different periods in time. Players must destroy a set number of enemy ships, after which an end-of-level guardian appears. Once this is destroyed the player's ship warps to the next stage. 

The player's ship is armed with both a forward-firing gun and an infinite number of homing missiles. Each stage consists of both green and metallic enemies, the green enemies can be destroyed with the standard gun, but both metallic enemies and the end-of-stage guardian can only be killed with homing missiles. As the player's ship gets close to a metallic enemy, a "lock-on" square will appear over it, fired homing missiles will then follow and hit the enemy. 

Unlike the prequel, which displayed the year in which each level was set, the time periods of 'Time Pilot '84' are indicated by new enemies and different backgrounds.

		<desc>Thrash Rally is a top-down perspective rally racing game for one or two players. Each race begins with players asked to choose a vehicle in which to race, with each offering a different balance between handling, acceleration, vehicle endurance and top speed. 

There are two racing modes on offer. The first, World Rally Championship, features rounds that take place over lap-based circuits, with each lap having to be completed within a set time limit. World Rally mode offers players a choice of six different rally cars.

The second mode is the Paris-to-Dakar rally. This doesn’t feature laps but is a point-to-point race, with each stage having to be completed within a set time limit. In addition to the six rally cars of the World Rally mode, the Paris-to-Dakar Rally also allows players to race in either a buggy, a motorbike, or a truck.

All tracks feature a variety of different road surfaces, such as snow, gravel, sand or water. Many of the tracks also feature a variety of jumps and chicanes, as well as track-based obstacles that should be avoided.

		<name>Treasure Hunt (bootleg?) </name>
		<desc>This game plays a lot like "Donkey Kong" except that the controls are not quite as smooth. There are five screens to master if you want to help Jack in his mission. You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen one right to screen four.
* The first screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).
* In the second screen, Jack maneuvers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.
* The third screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.
* On the fourth screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.
* The fifth screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).

After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.

		<desc>Three shooting games in one unit; Hit the Bear, Witch Hunt and Racoon Hunt. The operator can select any one of the three games for his location and change it periodically merely by putting new graphic panels in and adjusting a switch on the P.C. board.

Hit The Bear is a modern video version of the classic bear shooting game. Realistically animated bears walk through a 3-D green forest. When hit, the bear roars, stands up and turns to walk in the opposite direction.

The Witch Hunt game changes the setting to a mysterious haunted house where players shoot at ghosts appearing in the windows and witches and bats flying across the screen.

In Racoon Hunt, players shoot at racoons climbing trees in an Autumn forest. The objective is to keep the racoons from reaching the top of the trees as they climb faster and faster as the score goes up.

		<name>Tropical Angel </name>
		<desc>An abstract take on the 3d racing genre, Tropical Angel puts the player in control of a female water-skier who must dodge the many rocks that protrude from the water while attempting to steer through a set number of gates - in the form of a pair of flags - before the time limit expires. The acceleration button needs to be held down all the time while the 'trick' button makes the water-skiing girl spin through one-eighty degrees and proceed to ski backwards. The player cannot steer while traveling backwards, but will earn bonus points for the duration of the trick. As the game progresses, small ramps, buoys and sharks come into play. The small ramps can be jumped to add to the player's score, although they're always in difficult to reach locations. The buoys are usually very close together, but skiing between them earns bonus points. Finally, the shark will appear from time-to-time, running into it means game over, regardless of how much time the player has left.

		<desc>1 to 4 players take on the role of a cute dinosaur, selected from the four on offer : Rex (red), Bloop (blue), Spike (yellow) and Gwen (lavender). The game takes place in a prehistoric land called 'Og' and is made up of forty-nine different islands; the dinos must collect all of the dinosaur eggs that lay on the islands, while avoiding the unwanted attention of a tribe of one-eyed cavemen, called 'Trogs'. The dinos can punch the attacking Trogs; one punch will only stun a Trog but several punches will knock the enemy off the screen. There are 4 different Trogs who pursue the dinos :
* Brown Trogs who use only their fists.
* Red Trogs who use clubs and create fires or holes in the ground.
* Blue Trogs who pop up out of the ground and roll stone wheels.
* Green Trogs who bounce around trying to crush you with their springs.
On each island, after the dinos have gathered up all of their eggs, they must make their way to the base labeled 'Home'; from here they will move on to the next island.

Between each stage, there is an intermission where the players' Dinos will dance, with an on-screen caption proudly declaring 'Excellent!', 'Congratulations!', 'Nice Work!', 'Good Job!' or 'Dino-Mite!'. On occasion, an intermission screen appears that shows a Trog planning another attempt to eat a Dino.

		<name>Tron (8/9) </name>
		<desc>Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name.

Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called "domains", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen.

The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows:

* LIGHT CYCLES : The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed.

* I/O TOWER : Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* TANK MAZE : Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. "Recognizer" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

* MCP CONE : Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.

Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the "SCORING" section for details).

		<name>Turkey Shoot </name>
		<desc>The year is 1989, one year after the great gobble blight which plagued the world. One-third of the earth's populace was transformed by the ailment. The side effect of the turkey transformation is a tendency toward violence and comradery between these turkeys to organize for rabble-rousing in the urban areas. In February of '89, a group of specially trained agents (the turkey terminators) was formed for the sole task of destroying the turkey menace...

And so it begins. As a Turkey Terminator, the player is given 100 missions and 3 weapons to eliminate all the turkeys, leaving no 'left-overs'. He can take aim with his lethal laser gun using the position dot on the screen Screen-shot to hone in on his enemies with deadly accuracy. He can launch a lit grenade to annihilate all the turkeys within range or he can activate his gobble button (available one time each mission) to freeze all the turkeys for an instant, making them 'sitting ducks'. Missions are varied and include reacting quickly to clever ploys such as turkey air raids, turkeys disguising themselves as businessmen and turkey helicopter get-aways. Every 8th round is a rapid-fire bonus wave where the player has 15 seconds to eliminate as many criminals as possible. Shooting fire hydrants and trash cans as well as freeing bystanders who have been taken hostage also score bonus points.

Three 'fowl-ups' are allowed and occur whenever any turkey... a Pilot Turkey, Boss Turkey, Cyborg Turkey or Thug Turkey... escapes or when an innocent bystander... a businessman, shopper or policeman... is damaged.

		<desc>Sega's Turbo is a 3-D racing game from Sega in which the player must pass a set number of rival racers (usually 30) before the time limit expires. Success would see the player progress to the next stage. Turbo's gameplay was unique in that centered ENTIRELY on the passing of cars; while the tracks the player raced on had all of the usual bends and turns of the racing genre, they existed purely for effect and at no point did the player actually have to STEER through them.

Turbo was the world's first full-color, sprite scaling racing game and not, as many assume, Namco's "Pole Position". Turbo was released a full year before the Namco legend and is a further example of how Sega has dominated and innovated within the arcade racing genre.

Top scores were kept on a LED panel to the left of the screen (unfortunately these scores reset every-time you turn the game off).

		<name>Twin Eagle II - The Rescue Mission </name>
		<desc>Twin Eagle II is a vertical scrolling shooter where one or two players pilot heavily armed helicopters through three stages with three areas each.

At the start of each stage, the players select their path of attack through the three areas.  Areas with ground level enemies and targets are presented in a 3/4 isometric view, while areas with no ground targets feature scrolling landscape images.  Players use their guns to attack flying enemy aircraft and bombs to attack ground targets such as tanks, rocket launchers and high-rise skyscrapers.  If things get too hairy, the player can use a missile barrage to clear the screen of enemies and enemy firepower.  Destroying some buildings reveal primary colored trucks which drop weapon power-ups and point items when destroyed.  Each area features a boss at the end, which must be destroyed to advance past the area.  The final stage features one additional boss before the end of the game.

		<name>Two Tigers (dedicated) </name>
		<desc>Two Tigers is a 2-D shooter. The game starts by telling you how may hits you must make on the ship before you can claim credit for sinking it. You then will go to the next screen which has your fighter/bomber in the middle of the screen. A gunsight will also be somewhere in the sky (the gunsight is actually the spot where anti-aircraft fire will be hitting at). Soon the sky is filled with enemy planes and a ship enters the screen from the left side. You mission will be to do whatever it takes to put the required number of holes into the enemy ship to sink it. You have at your disposal a single bomb and the enemy planes themselves for achieving your goal. Along the way, other things may assist (if you shoot them) such as mines and fuel drums. The game will go until you fail to sink 2 ships. If you are in 2-player cooperative mode, then the number of holes to sink a ship will be increased. The same rules apply, though, for sending it to the bottom of the sea.

		<desc>Ultimate Ecology is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up with an ecological theme, in which the player must battle a ruthless mega corporation that is slowly destroying the Earth's eco systems with its industrial machines. 

As well as superbly rendered graphics, Eco Fighters features an interesting play mechanic with the addition of an extended metal arm mounted on the side of the player's ship. On the end of the arm is a weapon that can be rotated through 360 degrees. This weapon comes in four different forms; Energy Ball, Long-range Hammer, Laser Sword or Scatter-Bomb foil. The rotatable weapon can be powered up before being fired, in a similar fashion to the 'Force' weapon that featured in Irem's "R*Type". The rotatable weapon is also impervious to all enemy contact and can be used as a shield. 

In addition to the rotating weapon, the player's ship is also equipped with forward-firing laser guns. Both the guns and rotatable weapon can be powered-up with greater shot power when the relevant icon is picked up.

		<name>Puzzle Uo Poko (International) </name>
		<desc>Uo Poko is a puzzle game for one or two players (co-operative). The aim is to clear the screen of coloured glass balls by dropping like-coloured balls down onto them. Connecting three or more like-coloured balls creates a chain reaction and causes them to disappear.

Balls are launched into the play area via a joystick controlled 'pinball-plunger' and as in Pinball, the further the plunger is pulled back, the further the coloured ball will travel. Mastering the strength and distance required is essential in order to drop each ball accurately onto its target. To allow players to learn how to use the plunger, the first two stages feature a guide line which shows exactly where a ball will drop. From the third stage onwards, players must use their judgement alone.

Bonus points are awarded if a stage is completed quickly enough. If too much time is taken, however, the bottom of the stage will start to rise, pushing the balls already in play towards the top of the screen. If the top of the screen is reached, the game is over.

Uo Poko features thirty stages of play.

		<name>Up'n Down (not encrypted) </name>
		<desc>Up'n Down is an abstract racing game viewed in a forced third-person perspective. 

The goal of the game is to collect coloured flags, while avoiding the enemy vehicles and obstacles that litter each course. The flags needed are displayed at the top of the screen and are coloured as follows: Light green, blue, red, olive, dark green, magenta, yellow and black. If the flags are collected quickly enough, bonus points are awarded. Collected flags remain visible on the track but are changed to white in colour.

In addition to the enemy vehicles, other hazards to be negotiated include potholes, broken bridges, steep hills and sharp corners. The player's vehicle can jump over both obstacles and vehicles, and if players land their vehicle on an enemy vehicle, the enemy is destroyed. Jumping at the wrong time, however, can send the player's vehicle into the path of an enemy, or off the track completely, resulting in the loss of a life. Players can also control the speed of their vehicle and even move in reverse.

Each round is progressively more difficult than the last, with more obstacles and enemy vehicles littering the courses.

		<name>Valkyrie No Densetsu (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Valkyrie no Densetsu is an action/adventure game by Namco and conversion of the arcade game of the same name. A cute and courageous young Valkyrie is sent from heaven to save the country of Marvel Land. She is accompanied by Sandora, a green looking creature from the Sandora clan who is on a long journey in search of the Golden Seed, a magical artifact capable of granting all wishes. But the seed has only brought chaos and disaster to the world and Valkyrie is given the mission to find it and to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands. With her sword and magic powers, she travels through six large areas - from swamps to rocky hills, deep caves and creepy dungeons. Coins can be collected along the way to purchase various items and new weapons from shops scattered (and sometimes hidden) around the game. The extensive list of items ranges from additional health containers, healing herb, wide beam shots, drill shots, four-way shots and so forth. Each special weapon only come in limited quantities though and disappears when it runs out of ammo. Valkyrie can also use her divine magic powers to cast powerful spells such as the multiple-valkyrie, the bomb or one that makes her grow to an enormous size. The game has somewhat of an adventure feel to it and each area has its share of special events that need to be resolved for extra bonuses. Other stages feature hidden villagers who ask the valkyrie questions and right answers are rewarded with special items or spells. Later stages also have a non-linear structure to them and different paths lead to different areas to explore. The game is vast and a password system allows the player to continue an earlier game.

		<desc>So you enlisted for adventure, did you? Well, you've come to the right place. Your mission is to reach the City of Mystery at the end of the tunnel and destroy the great Gond with your four- directional laser guns. Sound easy? Wait and see.

First you have to make it through the seven tunnel zones without getting smashed on the tunnel walls, crunched by enemy objects, or zapped by missiles. The more enemy objects you destroy, the more points you earn, but the rougher it gets. If you make it to the City of Mystery and destroy Gond, you earn bonus points. Then you head into the next tunnel, which also leads to the City of Mystery and Gond. Then what? Well, to quote an old Aterrian saying, "Life is just one tunnel after another."

Now before you climb into your spaceship and enter the first tunnel, take a look at the options.

		<desc>Based on the Exidy arcade video game.

In this unique game, you control Winky - the heroic adventurer - who is off on an expedition to claim the treasures that lay hidden in the dungeon. Each treasure is in a chamber - protected by dangerous monsters. He must use his bow and arrow to ward off the monsters and claim the treasures. The more he ventures - the more he gains!

		<name>Venture (version 5 set 2) </name>
		<desc>Venture is a 1- or 2-player "Gauntlet" style game (although Venture pre-dates the Atari legend by 4 years) set in a multi-level dungeon. The player, armed with a bow and arrow fights through enemy infested levels in the quest to collect treasure.

Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of "Space Invader" like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.

When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice. Once a room has been cleared of its item, the player no longer has access to that room. The player must collect all of the treasures on the current level before descending to another dungeon.

		<desc>Pinball ball. The object of the game is to keep the ball in play as long as possible and to score as many points as possible.

VIDEO PINBALL has four exciting game variations. There are two games for one player and two games for two players. The variations are:

GAME 1 is a one-player game. GAME 1 allows you to nudge the ball. Too much nudge will cause you to lose the ball (TILT) and any extra ball is lost. During GAME 1 the bumper values are accumulated for an entire game.

GAME 2 is a two-player version of GAME 1. Each player takes at turn with one ball at a time. The turn lasts until the ball drains. Each player's score appears at the top of the screen with each turn. The left player is always number one.

GAME 3 is a one-player game similar to GAME 1 except that the bumper values are not accumulated. The bumper values are reset with each new ball. GAME 3 is just a bit tougher than GAME 1. For a real challenge, try GAME 3 with difficulty level a.

GAME 4 is a two-player version of GAME 3. Each player takes a turn with one ball at a time. The turn lasts until the ball drains. Each player's score appears at the top of the screen with each turn. As in GAME 2, the left player starts the game.

		<desc>Control different characters with various fighting styles and engage in single or two-player bouts.

In the early 1950's, a game called Violence Fight was popular in the US crime world. Fighters from all over the USA would compete against each other to become that year's champion. The winner stood to make a considerable amount of money. 

In downtown LA, a manager called Blinks is training up a new fighter called Bad Blue. He is a strong contender to become the champion and desperately needs the prize money.

		<name>Volfied (World, revision 1) </name>
		<desc>The game principle is really simple: you must fill up the playfield (or more than 75%) and destroy the main Boss. You start at the bottom of the screen and your ship, when in motion, leaves a red trail (your ship won't move until you press II). Connect to another line (not your red trail !!!) and the enclosed area becomes yours. Any enemy contained within this area is then destroyed. Your ship is always protected by a shield, except when producing a trail... But pods are dotted around the field, enclose them and they will leave power ups: 'L' for lasers, 'S' for speed ups, 'T' will freeze all enemies for a time limit, 'C' will destroy all small enemies, '1up' for extra life, and the Star will give you a powerful laser !!!

A number of power-ups are available, revealed when certain sections of the background have been filled, such as Speed-up, temporary enemy freeze and laser. The player's ship is only in danger from the game's enemies while the player is actually drawing a line. Each level must be completed within a tight time limit.

		<desc>Vulgus is pretty simple. You just pilot a spaceship and blast countless enemies. That is what is fun about this game. There is nothing complicated, just pure blasting. You only have two weapons, your blaster, and a limited supply of bombs. This title uses the time honored top-down vertically scrolling format. The background moves eternally forward, but you can move all around the screen, and can make the screen scroll both left and right. Your enemies consist of an assortment of fairly realistic looking spacecraft, some of which have a distinctive 'insectoid' look to them. This game is endless and it doesn't seem to have a level format. You just move forward and shoot. The backgrounds will change from time to time from planetary surfaces to space scenes and eventually they will start repeating once you blast this particularly large alien formation.

The terrain is an orange moon scene, various cartoonish monsters dot the landscape. You must blast the monsters in pairs to make them vanish. Later levels introduce even more complex rules as to what can be shot. You control your ship with the trackball, while using the joystick to aim and shoot. The controls feel natural with a little practice, but the game quickly becomes very difficult on the higher levels.

		<name>Warlords </name>
		<desc>Atari's Warlords depicts a third-person view of four castles. The player-controlled Warlords and computer-controlled Black Knights use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. 

Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles, using their shield control and 'Power Stone' pushbutton. When a fireball hits a castle wall, it destroys one or more bricks, depending on its speed. 

A castle not paid for is controlled by the computer, with a Black Knight displayed in the appropriate castle. The Black Knights catapult fireballs at the players with increasing accuracy, to provide challenge. 

Game play begins when any start button is pressed and the countdown has ended. The game ends when the last Warlord's castle (containing a crown) has been penetrated by a fireball. At this point a white cloud envelopes the crown, and the latter disappears. 

During the countdown, a dragon flies back and forth across the screen with a fireball in its mouth. At the end of the countdown, a position activated by a start button has its Black Knight changed to a Warlord's crown. A position not activated remains as a Black Knight and is controlled by the computer. The dragon then spits the fireball from its mouth toward a Warlord's castle. 

The objective is to destroy the three other castles, while protecting one's own castle with the moving shield. The LED pushbuttons have dual functions: in the ready-to-play mode they work as start switches, and during game play they become 'Power Stones' to allow players to capture and catapult fireballs at opponents. 

The spinning fireballs released from a shield have more destructive force on a castle wall than a fireball simply deflected from another wall or the sides of the playfield. However, players will soon find out that they cannot hold onto a fireball for long, since it slowly destroys their own castle walls adjacent to the fireball. 

Additional fireballs appear at predetermined intervals or when a castle is destroyed, whichever comes first. A maximum of four fireballs simultaneously appear on the screen. 

In 1- and 2-player games, the Warlords' crowns will be accompanied by a zero, to begin scoring. The point-scoring system is printed on each control panel (the Black Knights do not earn points). 

If a Black Knight has the surviving castle, the game ends. However, if a Warlord has the surviving castle, that player receives bonus points, all castles are rebuilt, and the game continues with a new battle at a higher level. In a 2-player game, both players continue in the game, but only one player can get bonus points. If both Black Knights are eliminated first and only Warlords remain, the level becomes a free-for-all between the two Warlords until one is eliminated. The other Warlord then gets the bonus points, and the game begins again. 

The subsequent levels begin, as mentioned before, with the fireball thrown out by the dragon. In the higher levels, Black Knights play more accurately and faster. 

3- and 4-player games (available in the cocktail version only) are free-for-alls. No scores are kept, and the game ends as soon as there is only one castle left.

		<name>Warrior Blade - Rastan Saga Episode III (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Warrior Blade is a fantasy-themed hack-and-slash game for one or two players, featuring both horizontal and vertically scrolling levels. Unlike previous Rastan games that featured only Rastan himself, players can now choose to play as one of three different warriors: Rastan, Dewey (a hireling) or Sophia (a thief).

Players must then fight their way through a multitude of enemy-packed levels set in a variety of different locations, such as castles, a forest, a swamp and on board a sinking ship. Certain levels also have the players riding on animals, such as horses and dragons. Coins and treasure items can be found in the numerous barrels and chests that litter the levels, as well as being dropped by some defeated enemies. Bonus points and "vitality" - depending on the amount of treasure collected - are awarded upon the level's completion.

As well as coins and treasure, other bonus items can be found that give weapon and magical-weapon power-ups, as well as extra vitality (health).

Level progression through the game is not linear. After the very first level, "Depon Road", players are presented with a map of the Kingdom, and can choose which of four different routes they wish to take next. The available routes are; Castle (Northwest), Tower (Northeast), Ship (Southwest) and Palace (Southeast).

		<desc>A demanding yet superb sprite-scaling racing game from Konami, based on the annual 'WEC Le Mans 24' race; a grueling event that, as its name suggests, takes place over a 24-hour period.

The width of Le Mans' racetrack never varied and remained a constant 3 lanes wide. The track itself was incredibly demanding and contact with either a rival racer or one of the many track-side objects would send the player's vehicle flying dramatically through the air, costing valuable seconds in time.

		<name>Willow (Japan) </name>
		<desc>Willow is a sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up game loosely based upon the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of one of two characters: Willow Ufgood or Madmartigan. The hero's mission is to rescue the baby Elora Danan from the evil Queen Bavmorda and bring her back safely. If the quest fails, the Queen will plunge the world into darkness and chaos.

The game consists of 6 levels, each representing a scene from the movie. Defeated enemies drop gold coins that can be collected by the player. In addition, each level is littered with locked treasure chests that can be shot open and the treasure within collected. The gold can be used to purchase a number of weapons and character power-ups from a nearby shop (represented on screen by a wise old man). All power-ups will stay with the player until all lives are lost and the game is over.

		<desc>This is one great looking game. You control a little tank that can move back and forth at the bottom of the screen, your enemies are martian walkers that advance on your position. Each martian takes several hits to destroy, as you are actually blasting their legs out from under them. You can protect yourself from their shots by using your shield button, but use it sparingly, as you only have a limited amount of shield time.

		<name>Wizard of Wor </name>
		<desc>Welcome to WIZARD OF WOR! In this magical game, you are a worrior descending into deep dungeon mazes, battling invisible monsters, cacodemons, and maybe even the Wizard of Wor himself! Be of good cheer, worrior, for herein lie many of the secrets of the Wizard. 

Wizard of Wor is a game for 1 or 2 players. When the 2-player mode is selected, both players control their worriors at the same time. Teamwork in the 2-player mode is very important (but not necessary to play). 

The object of Wizard of Wor is to descend as far into the dungeons of Wor as possible, killing monsters, beating the Wizard, and earning as high a score as you can. The game ends when all the players' worriors have been destroyed. 

At the start of the game, you are placed in dungeon one. It contains six blue Burwors. Using the joystick and fire button, maneuver your worrior around the maze and shoot them. As you shoot the last Burwor, a yellow Garwor will come out. Garwors and red Thorwors will turn invisible. The radar will show the positions of the invisible monsters. Invisible Garwors and Thorwors will become visible when they enter the same corridor that a worrior is in. As time goes by, the monsters speed up. The longer it takes before you shoot them, the faster they go. When you have destroyed the Thorwor, the first dungeon ends. 

In the 2nd dungeon, a different maze is randomly selected. Once again, six Burwors are placed here. More Garwors and Thorwors will appear this time, however. When the last Thorwor has been shot, Worluk will come out and try to escape out one of the side doors. If you shoot him before he escapes, all point values will be doubled in the next dungeon. After Worluk has been shot or has escaped, the Wizard of Wor may then appear. He teleports closer and closer, continuously firing lightning bolts. He continues to do so until either one worrior has been destroyed, or the Wizard has been shot. 

After dungeon 3 or 4, a bonus player is awarded (option switch selectable). You must then face the Arena. This is the toughest of the lower level dungeons. The Worlord dungeons begin at dungeon eight. They are very difficult to survive. At dungeon thirteen, another bonus player is awarded, and you must try to win your way through The Pit. The ultimate goal of Wizard of Wor is to survive The Pit without losing any worriors. 

In a 1-player game, the other worrior (blue) is your friend. He will not shoot you unless you come between him and a monster, then he will try to shoot the monster, and you could be hit by his shot. 
In a 2-player game, both players play at the same time. They do not take turns. The two players may elect to shoot each other. But, if you wish to survive for long, you must use teamwork! 

And now worrior, go forth and do battle with the Wizard of Wor!

Xybots was another in a long line of videogame innovations from Atari. The company had, of course, created the first commercially successful videogame with the legendary "Pong". They went on to develop vector graphics with 1979's "Lunar Lander"; while 1980's "Battlezone" was on the cutting edge of technology with its hitherto unknown three-dimensional vector rendering. 

Xybots was the first arcade game to put the player into a three-dimensional, third-person perspective world (with the action viewed from over the on-screen characters' shoulders). Xybots can rightly be considered to be the father of the modern day first person three-dimensional shoot-em-ups. 

By 1987, Atari had split into two different companies; with each sharing the Atari name. The first company produced products for the home entertainment arena; such as personal computers, game consoles, and handhelds. The arcade company, owned by Midway, produced arcade machines exclusively. Perhaps because Xybots was so ahead of its time, it wasn't the commercial success that Atari and Midway were hoping for. Its legacy and influence on future shoot-em-ups, however, is without question. 

Xybots was originally going to be "Gauntlet III", before Atari changed its mind and created a new Sci-fi setting.  It's development name was "Robox" until the game was completed.

The monsters and shots were rendered with 'motion objects', a method which had been around since 1977. 

Joel Hedge holds the official official record for this game, on tournament setting, with 185,300 points on June 2, 2001.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

You start you game with your man (or men in the two-player game) standing at the end of a corridor. Your goal is to make it to the exit while inflicting the most amount of damage without taking too much damage. There is also a quick tutorial during this first level to help you better gain experience for the coming levels.

General Strategies :
* Always look at the level map when you enter a level. There will be a couple of second delay before you enter the level. Look for where the exit is. This also helps to determine whether you are being put in the middle of a group of Xybots.

* Your character can lose energy in a variety of ways :
1) Naturally within the maze itself. You lose 2-3% of your energy in the maze per second. If you purchase the Extra Vitality, your energy will be lost at a slower rate. This rate is usually about 1% per second.
2) Saucers that go Kamikaze will take out 25% of your energy when they hit.
3) All other Xybots take out 10% energy per hit, but they usually fire multiple times.
4) Using the Zapper.

* Saucers like to pick up items and carry them to other parts of the level. This can be especially frustrating if you know where an item is, then return to find it gone because a saucer picked it up. Keep this in mind unless you have taken out all the saucers.

* Money is a very precious commodity in this game. This is what you use to buy the permanent and temporary items in the Supply Store. After level 7, you will be buying everything you need to get through the level. At the bare minimum, you should constantly purchase the following :
1) Wall Mapper x 3 - To give you an idea of how the maze is set up and also where the closest exit is.
2) Monster Mapper x 3 - To give you a general idea of what non-Guardian Xybots are running around.
3) Vitality x 4 - To minimize the amount of energy you lose on the level.
4) These purchases will last you a minimum of three levels before you have to purchase more temporary items.

* Keys are another valuable commodity within the mazes. Keys can open doors that can shorten one's trip to the exit, or they can open doors that have a lot of extra items in them.

* In addition to the above, attempt to get permanent items when you can. The best ones would be extra armor and shot power.

* Use the Warp Exits when you can. With the 75,000 points, you get 3 coins added to the bonus coins for using the warp. In addition, your energy is brought back to 100% again so you don't have to waste money healing up. The warp exits are located on levels 1 and 4.

* Energy orbs can give either a 50% or 100% boost to your energy. If you are only down a little, do not use it. Wait until you are under 50% energy before getting one.

* If you are placed in a wide open area, immediately look for the exit or find a protected corner. This prevents the Xybots from surrounding your character.

* Xybots follow a specific pattern when they move around. Once they spot your character, though, they will immediately go in for the attack. Sometimes multiple Xybots will swarm the area to try to eliminate your character quickly.

* When approaching corridors that turn, doorways, or openings in the wall, turn your character toward that area and sidestep to the turn or opening. That way, if there are any Xybots lurking around, you can get the first shot in and take them out before they know what happened to them.

* Your character's range of vision is four squares around. It is the same for the Xybots. When going down corridors, it's a good idea to put a few shots ''down-range''. The reason is you may catch one of the Xybots ''napping'' and eliminate them before they can react.

* When approaching openings or doorways, stop short of said opening. If a Xybot is patrolling, they won't see your character but you will see their movement pattern and then you can plan accordingly.

* Many of the levels have blue barrels. These can be used for cover when you are busy having shootouts with the Xybots. Just ''peek'' around them to get your shots off.

* Speaking of blue barrels, you can use the Zapper on them to collect items. These items are random.

* Don't use the Zapper unless it is absolutely necessary. Its purpose is to stun the enemies for a couple of seconds. This makes them vulnerable to your attacks. The energy loss to do this, though, is an uneven exchange. You will do better just shooting it out with the Xybots. Of course, if you are surrounded, then that would be a good time to use it.

* When fighting the Flys, keep in mind that they move up-and-down in addition to side-to-side making them very hard targets to hit. It addition, you will need to keep moving around to avoid their fire and the blue barrels provide minimal protection since they can fire above them.

* The teleporters in the maze act in a duel fashion. When you step on one teleporter pad, you will arrive at another one. Get off and step back on the teleporter pad you just arrived on to teleport to another place. Levels with multiple teleporter pads can be very confusing unless you do this.

* Make sure you pick your battles. If you are on a level loaded with Xybots, it may be better to find the exit then to shoot it out with them. Granted, you can get the points, items in the maze, and possible coin bonuses for score. This, though, may be an unfair exchange since you will be taking a large energy drain with little return.

* Watch your energy meter. It will go yellow when you are at 50% and go red when you are at 20% or less.

* Make sure you note the Xybots colors when you are fighting them. This is the key to tell you how many hits it will take to take them down. Don't be surprised if you hit a Xybot once and it is still firing on you.

* Some levels have false walls. These walls can be taken out with your laser fire. They do not show up differently on the main level map. Before you go shooting at the walls, make sure of what is behind those walls. Opening one of these walls could be like kicking a hornet's nest. You find yourself surrounded by Xybots intent on erasing you from existence.

* Some of the levels have a ''wrap-around'' feature. This basically means if you exit the maze on the right side, you will reappear on the left side. It gives the illusion of one continuous maze. On these types of mazes, when you look at the map, make sure you note enemies not only on your side, but on the opposite side as well.

* The big thing is to learn how to turn and move at the same time. This is in addition to being able to fire while performing this maneuver. If you can accomplish this smoothly, your chances of survival are greatly increased.

* On the first level, don't collect any money for totally massive bonus points at the end. And lots of cash.

* You can shoot around a wall to your right by putting your gun around the corner. You can shoot them but they cannot shoot you.

Two-Player Strategies : These strategies are in addition to the general strategies.

* First of all, each player is immune to the other player's shots.

* If all the Xybots are destroyed, the first player that exits the maze gets the bonus.

* The first player that exits the level gets a 5,000 point bonus.

* If one of the players enters the warp, both players will warp regardless of the other player's location.

* If one of the players dies, and the other makes it through that particular level, the other player is brought back with 50% energy. The other player also loses all the items they may have collected on that level. If both players die, the game is over.

* Learn to work with each other. The combined firepower of two people is quite significant if applied the right way.

* Watch each others back. When one person is facing one way, have the other face the other way in case some Xybots want to sneak up on you.

* In addition, watch in directions that you are unprotected. For example, in a corner one person can look straight while the other looks to one of the sides.

* Don't get greedy and have one player take everything. Learn to share items found. Also, share coins at the Supply Area so that both characters can get maximum benefits. This is a game of cooperation so treat it as such.

Boss Strategies : In order to eliminate the Master Xybot, you must take out all six of his lasers.

* You will be placed on a platform to the left of the Master Xybot. In front of you will be his hand with six openings in it.

* These openings flash at random. When they flash, they fire shots at your character. Your goal is to hit one of these openings when it is flashing. When you do, that opening is cannot fire shots anymore.

* You must run back and forth on the platform to not only avoid the laser fire, but to also shoot up the openings.

* You must take out all six openings in order to defeat the Master Xybot.

* On the later levels, the rate of fire from these openings gets faster.

Xybots was another in a long line of videogame innovations from Atari. The company had, of course, created the first commercially successful videogame with the legendary "Pong". They went on to develop vector graphics with 1979's "Lunar Lander"; while 1980's "Battlezone" was on the cutting edge of technology with its hitherto unknown three-dimensional vector rendering. 

Xybots was the first arcade game to put the player into a three-dimensional, third-person perspective world (with the action viewed from over the on-screen characters' shoulders). Xybots can rightly be considered to be the father of the modern day first person three-dimensional shoot-em-ups. 

By 1987, Atari had split into two different companies; with each sharing the Atari name. The first company produced products for the home entertainment arena; such as personal computers, game consoles, and handhelds. The arcade company, owned by Midway, produced arcade machines exclusively. Perhaps because Xybots was so ahead of its time, it wasn't the commercial success that Atari and Midway were hoping for. Its legacy and influence on future shoot-em-ups, however, is without question. 

Xybots was originally going to be "Gauntlet III", before Atari changed its mind and created a new Sci-fi setting.  It's development name was "Robox" until the game was completed.

The monsters and shots were rendered with 'motion objects', a method which had been around since 1977. 

Joel Hedge holds the official official record for this game, on tournament setting, with 185,300 points on June 2, 2001.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

You start you game with your man (or men in the two-player game) standing at the end of a corridor. Your goal is to make it to the exit while inflicting the most amount of damage without taking too much damage. There is also a quick tutorial during this first level to help you better gain experience for the coming levels.

General Strategies :
* Always look at the level map when you enter a level. There will be a couple of second delay before you enter the level. Look for where the exit is. This also helps to determine whether you are being put in the middle of a group of Xybots.

* Your character can lose energy in a variety of ways :
1) Naturally within the maze itself. You lose 2-3% of your energy in the maze per second. If you purchase the Extra Vitality, your energy will be lost at a slower rate. This rate is usually about 1% per second.
2) Saucers that go Kamikaze will take out 25% of your energy when they hit.
3) All other Xybots take out 10% energy per hit, but they usually fire multiple times.
4) Using the Zapper.

* Saucers like to pick up items and carry them to other parts of the level. This can be especially frustrating if you know where an item is, then return to find it gone because a saucer picked it up. Keep this in mind unless you have taken out all the saucers.

* Money is a very precious commodity in this game. This is what you use to buy the permanent and temporary items in the Supply Store. After level 7, you will be buying everything you need to get through the level. At the bare minimum, you should constantly purchase the following :
1) Wall Mapper x 3 - To give you an idea of how the maze is set up and also where the closest exit is.
2) Monster Mapper x 3 - To give you a general idea of what non-Guardian Xybots are running around.
3) Vitality x 4 - To minimize the amount of energy you lose on the level.
4) These purchases will last you a minimum of three levels before you have to purchase more temporary items.

* Keys are another valuable commodity within the mazes. Keys can open doors that can shorten one's trip to the exit, or they can open doors that have a lot of extra items in them.

* In addition to the above, attempt to get permanent items when you can. The best ones would be extra armor and shot power.

* Use the Warp Exits when you can. With the 75,000 points, you get 3 coins added to the bonus coins for using the warp. In addition, your energy is brought back to 100% again so you don't have to waste money healing up. The warp exits are located on levels 1 and 4.

* Energy orbs can give either a 50% or 100% boost to your energy. If you are only down a little, do not use it. Wait until you are under 50% energy before getting one.

* If you are placed in a wide open area, immediately look for the exit or find a protected corner. This prevents the Xybots from surrounding your character.

* Xybots follow a specific pattern when they move around. Once they spot your character, though, they will immediately go in for the attack. Sometimes multiple Xybots will swarm the area to try to eliminate your character quickly.

* When approaching corridors that turn, doorways, or openings in the wall, turn your character toward that area and sidestep to the turn or opening. That way, if there are any Xybots lurking around, you can get the first shot in and take them out before they know what happened to them.

* Your character's range of vision is four squares around. It is the same for the Xybots. When going down corridors, it's a good idea to put a few shots ''down-range''. The reason is you may catch one of the Xybots ''napping'' and eliminate them before they can react.

* When approaching openings or doorways, stop short of said opening. If a Xybot is patrolling, they won't see your character but you will see their movement pattern and then you can plan accordingly.

* Many of the levels have blue barrels. These can be used for cover when you are busy having shootouts with the Xybots. Just ''peek'' around them to get your shots off.

* Speaking of blue barrels, you can use the Zapper on them to collect items. These items are random.

* Don't use the Zapper unless it is absolutely necessary. Its purpose is to stun the enemies for a couple of seconds. This makes them vulnerable to your attacks. The energy loss to do this, though, is an uneven exchange. You will do better just shooting it out with the Xybots. Of course, if you are surrounded, then that would be a good time to use it.

* When fighting the Flys, keep in mind that they move up-and-down in addition to side-to-side making them very hard targets to hit. It addition, you will need to keep moving around to avoid their fire and the blue barrels provide minimal protection since they can fire above them.

* The teleporters in the maze act in a duel fashion. When you step on one teleporter pad, you will arrive at another one. Get off and step back on the teleporter pad you just arrived on to teleport to another place. Levels with multiple teleporter pads can be very confusing unless you do this.

* Make sure you pick your battles. If you are on a level loaded with Xybots, it may be better to find the exit then to shoot it out with them. Granted, you can get the points, items in the maze, and possible coin bonuses for score. This, though, may be an unfair exchange since you will be taking a large energy drain with little return.

* Watch your energy meter. It will go yellow when you are at 50% and go red when you are at 20% or less.

* Make sure you note the Xybots colors when you are fighting them. This is the key to tell you how many hits it will take to take them down. Don't be surprised if you hit a Xybot once and it is still firing on you.

* Some levels have false walls. These walls can be taken out with your laser fire. They do not show up differently on the main level map. Before you go shooting at the walls, make sure of what is behind those walls. Opening one of these walls could be like kicking a hornet's nest. You find yourself surrounded by Xybots intent on erasing you from existence.

* Some of the levels have a ''wrap-around'' feature. This basically means if you exit the maze on the right side, you will reappear on the left side. It gives the illusion of one continuous maze. On these types of mazes, when you look at the map, make sure you note enemies not only on your side, but on the opposite side as well.

* The big thing is to learn how to turn and move at the same time. This is in addition to being able to fire while performing this maneuver. If you can accomplish this smoothly, your chances of survival are greatly increased.

* On the first level, don't collect any money for totally massive bonus points at the end. And lots of cash.

* You can shoot around a wall to your right by putting your gun around the corner. You can shoot them but they cannot shoot you.

Two-Player Strategies : These strategies are in addition to the general strategies.

* First of all, each player is immune to the other player's shots.

* If all the Xybots are destroyed, the first player that exits the maze gets the bonus.

* The first player that exits the level gets a 5,000 point bonus.

* If one of the players enters the warp, both players will warp regardless of the other player's location.

* If one of the players dies, and the other makes it through that particular level, the other player is brought back with 50% energy. The other player also loses all the items they may have collected on that level. If both players die, the game is over.

* Learn to work with each other. The combined firepower of two people is quite significant if applied the right way.

* Watch each others back. When one person is facing one way, have the other face the other way in case some Xybots want to sneak up on you.

* In addition, watch in directions that you are unprotected. For example, in a corner one person can look straight while the other looks to one of the sides.

* Don't get greedy and have one player take everything. Learn to share items found. Also, share coins at the Supply Area so that both characters can get maximum benefits. This is a game of cooperation so treat it as such.

Boss Strategies : In order to eliminate the Master Xybot, you must take out all six of his lasers.

* You will be placed on a platform to the left of the Master Xybot. In front of you will be his hand with six openings in it.

* These openings flash at random. When they flash, they fire shots at your character. Your goal is to hit one of these openings when it is flashing. When you do, that opening is cannot fire shots anymore.

* You must run back and forth on the platform to not only avoid the laser fire, but to also shoot up the openings.

* You must take out all six openings in order to defeat the Master Xybot.

* On the later levels, the rate of fire from these openings gets faster.

* If one of the players dies, and the other makes it through that particular level, the other player is brought back with 50% energy. The other player also loses all the items they may have collected on that level. If both players die, the game is over.

* Learn to work with each other. The combined firepower of two people is quite significant if applied the right way.

* Watch each others back. When one person is facing one way, have the other face the other way in case some Xybots want to sneak up on you.

* In addition, watch in directions that you are unprotected. For example, in a corner one person can look straight while the other looks to one of the sides.

* Don't get greedy and have one player take everything. Learn to share items found. Also, share coins at the Supply Area so that both characters can get maximum benefits. This is a game of cooperation so treat it as such.

Boss Strategies : In order to eliminate the Master Xybot, you must take out all six of his lasers.

* You will be placed on a platform to the left of the Master Xybot. In front of you will be his hand with six openings in it.

* These openings flash at random. When they flash, they fire shots at your character. Your goal is to hit one of these openings when it is flashing. When you do, that opening is cannot fire shots anymore.

* You must run back and forth on the platform to not only avoid the laser fire, but to also shoot up the openings.

* You must take out all six openings in order to defeat the Master Xybot.

* On the later levels, the rate of fire from these openings gets faster.

		<desc>Yie Ar Kung Fu is a classic one-on-one fighting game that pits a single player against a procession of distinctive, and often armed opponents. While somewhat limited in gameplay terms, Yie Ar Kung-Fu introduced a major innovation to the beat-em-up genre as it was the first one-on-one fighter to offer a progression of truly different opponents for the player to defeat. This is something that would later be adopted by Capcom for its legendary Street Fighter series; as well as SNK and countless others. Many of Yie Ar's eleven opponents are armed with a wide variety of weapons, such as a nunchuks, throwing stars, a chain, a sword and a club.

Yie Ar Kung-Fu is a game of reflexes and as such plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting 'pegged in' by some of the game's tougher opponents. The first five fights take place in front of an animated waterfall, while the remaining six have the player battling in front of a picturesque, oriental pagoda. There is no time limit set in which the opponent must be defeated and the player's character, Oolong, possesses a finite amount of health per stage. Should the player's health bar be fully depleted, the match is lost.

		<desc>In this title you play a little farmer guy, who is attempting to shoot down the crows out of his tree. Gameplay is identical to that of "Space Invaders". A large bird replaces the UFO that goes over the top of the screen from time to time. While a lumberjack will chop out a section of the tree every time the birds reach the side of the screen (lowering them closer to the bottom). The only real gameplay difference is that the birds come in a pyramid pattern, as opposed to the rectangle pattern of "Space Invaders". This serves to make the game much easier.

		<name>Zaxxon (set 2) </name>
		<desc>Zaxxon is a unique isometric perspective, in which you find yourself piloting an 'attack-shuttle' spacecraft, strafing the enemy's asteroid city in an attempt to destroy fuel tanks, gun emplacements, missiles, fighters and the dreaded Zaxxon enemy robot. With the aid of an altimeter that constantly monitors your height, you control your ship with an aircraft-style joystick, barnstorming your way through wall openings, under electronic barriers, dodging rockets, and in a later round, duelling with Zaxxon, the insidious enemy robot. A successful attack-run across the first platform leads us to a deep-space dogfight with enemy planes. As you climb, turn and dive, a 'cross-hair' appears on the screen to indicate exact positioning for a laser hit on incoming craft. Notice the buffeting as you fly near 'proximity explosions'. In addition to your altitude, a running count is displayed of your score, number of ships remaining to you, number of enemy ships remaining to be destroyed, and fuel remaining. Fuel bonuses, as well as points, are awarded for destroying fuel tanks, but your ship crashes if you run out of fuel between rounds.

After a specified number of enemy ships are destroyed, Zaxxon appears, launching seeker-missiles. Destruction of Zaxxon requires six direct hits on the robot's missile launcher, after which the round changes with greater difficulty. Number of player ships and bonus point levels are operator selectable. Game play ends with the loss of your last ship.

		<name>Zektor (revision B) </name>
		<desc>Zektor is a one- or two-player game that tasks you with the liberation of eight cities that have been seized by the evil cadre of alien robots. In order to liberate a city, you must defeat three attack waves of fighters and robo-probes. Fighters and Robo-probes are often shielded (in red), and each consecutive hit reduces the enemies shield strength, until, when the shield drops, a hit will destroy it. In addition, you will encounter three types of Moboids :
* Green Moboids spin the players ship on contact, and bounce enemy ships.
* Blue Moboids bounce all ships.
* Red Moboids destroy all un-shielded ships (including the players ship).

After defeating three attack waves, the Alien Robot holding that city will reappear within rotating protective rings, through which a 'slot shot' neutralizes that Robot, awarding the player a bonus ship and advancement to the next round.

		<desc>A challenging, vertical scrolling shooter.

On deep space you must fly the 'Zogram' (your spaceship fighter) and destroy hordes of enemies, while dodge space objects.

Destroy eight 'Mitiohro' around the 'Goke' (the enemy base) for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' (the enemy's fighter). After destroying all the 'Mitiohro', return to the 'Battlestar-asat' base.

The color of 'Mitiohro' on the picture changes when the gates for takeoff and landing of 'Ahro' opens. It is the time to attack!

As you destroy 'Ahro', 'Mitiohro' becomes to leave the 'Goke's' body, but you cannot destroy those 'Mitiohro' with your laser beam.

You can get a higher score depending of the precision landing of your spaceship at nearer spot to the center of the 'Battlestar-asat' base.

When you score 20,000 points, you can get one more Zogram and at 50,000 points you can get another Zogram.

		<name>Zoo Keeper (set 1) </name>
		<desc>Zoo Keeper is a superb, fast-paced arcade game in which the player takes control of Zeke the zoo-keeper. Many of the animals at Zeke's zoo are running wild and have captured Zeke's girlfriend, Zelda. Zeke must recapture as many animals as possible and rescue his sweetheart from the animals' clutches.

Zoo Keeper features two different, alternating play fields, with each level having its own task to complete; as well as a final 'bonus screen'. The three levels are as follows :

On the first play field, players must move Zeke around the outside of an animal enclosure, constantly re-building the enclosure wall that the animals are set on destroying. Any wild animals that are loose must be jumped over or the player will lose a life. The level's timer is represented as a fizzing fuse, and along this fuse are a number of bonus items such as beer or a net for catching escaped animals. When the timer's fuse reaches an item, it will appear on screen and can be picked up. Once the timer makes it to the word 'End', the current level is completed and play moves on to the next level. The bonus items that occasionally appear include mugs of beer, ice cream sundaes, clover clubs, watermelons, etc.

If Zeke manages to pick up a net, he will be able to capture the animals and put them back into the Zoo. The net will eventually disappear and the captured animals will try to escape once more by breaking through the enclosure wall. Zeke will have to continue building the wall around the Zoo until the time is up. At the end of the level, bonus points are awarded for every animal inside the wall. Animals found on this level are snakes, moose, camels, rhinos, elephants and a lion.

On the second, more difficult play field, Zelda is tied to a palm tree and Zeke must rescue her by jumping to the top of the screen via a series of moving platforms; dodging the coconuts thrown by a mischievous monkey. On each of the platforms, various foods and drinks can collected to earn extra points. Sometimes, one of the ledges will have a 'Free Game' sign that will grant the player a free credit. While Zelda is tied up, she says 'save me', and whenever Zeke gets knocked out by one of the deadly coconuts, she says 'Oh, no!' If Zeke makes it all the way to the top and rescues her, she says 'My Hero' and a bonus of 5000 points is awarded.

The first and second screens are alternated before the player finally reaches the third and final 'bonus screen'. Here, Zeke must jump over the herds of charging animals that are running from a cage at the foot of an escalator. Zeke must reach the escalator behind the animals' cage and make his way up to the next floor, where a second escalator - replete with more charging animals - awaits. Zeke must reach the top of the second escalator to rescue the trapped Zelda.

After Zeke has rescued Zelda on the final screen, the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.

		<desc>Zwackery was a sword-fighting and spell-casting game in which the player controls a cartoony wizard Zak Thwacker on a quest to restore an enchanted frog back into the buxom princess she once was. A platform-style exploration game, the world that Zak explores is actually dozens of different screens which the player exits and enters through doorways and tunnels in search of spell and other powerups that will help him defeat the Evil Ghoulum. The Sword can be used to stab, or it can be spun around the player. The Shield, which can be wielded in the same manner, provides protection. Spells include Bouncing Boots, Shooting Swords, Invisibility Potions, Magic flutes, and a Dragons Egg, which put Leapin Fungoes to sleep and allows safe passage through the Dragon's Lair.

		<desc>Perseverance will be overwhelming emotion game players as they move ZZYZZYXX up and down horizontal rows of alternating moving bricks to gather presents which will satisfy his love. Lola -- whose affection is not easily captured. ZZYZZYXX's vulnerability increases (as he collects gifts, as well as points) not only because of Lola's untouchable attitude, but because of obstacles such as rattifers trying to put an end to ZZYZZYXX's quest for Lola's love and affection.

Intelligent as the rattifers may be, there are 2 defenses ZZYZZYXX can use to outsmart the destructive creatures. ZZYZZYXX can brick himself within a brick when he sees an approaching rattifer or ZZYZZYXX can move into the space where there is a gold helmet. The gold helmet intensifies ZZYZZYXX's goal to reach Lola by allowing ZZYZZYXX to use the helmet to enclose a rattifer or break through one brick which is obstructing ZZYZZYXX's course towards Lola.

As irreproachable as Lola appears. Lola is overjoyed by ZZYZZYXX's success to retrieve enough presents and she whistles resoundingly to let ZZYZZYXX know. After ZZYZZYXX's triumphant deed for love. ZZYZZYXX becomes invincible, enabling him to elude the rattifers by imprisoning them within their spaces.

Other dangers testing ZZYZZYXX's skillful maneuvering are falling bombs, rising missiles and cracked bricks, each capable of disintegrating ZZYZZYXX.

As an added attraction, when a game player completes each level, there are animated cartoons depicting ZZYZZYXX's passionate desire to impress his love for Lola. Also delightful music throughout the game leaves the players humming and their foot tapping.

		<name>Tempest (rev 3, Revised Hardware) </name>
		<desc>2,295. 25,113 Upright units were produced. Tempest sold approximately 20,000 units to distributors before it was even released. 

Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. It is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace. 

Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. Tempest was originally a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone called 'Vortex', but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit. 

The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around. 

* The Creation of Tempest : Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different. 

Rich Adam : "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game... and he said to himself : 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.". 

* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. 

Dave Theurer : "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.". 

Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. 

Dan Pliskin : "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.". 

* Popular from the Start : Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. 

Lyle Rains : "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things". 

* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Not only did players often find a sense of welcome escape in the video games they played, but this was very much the intention of some of the great game designers. 

Dave Theurer : "I want to design it for a guy who's totally frazzled by his job and needs a way to temporarily escape. There's a certain class of games... where you just get into a trance when you're playing them. As long as you're in this trance you'll do fine." 

The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TEMPEST. 

A Tempest unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Twilight Zone - The Movie', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' (A cocktail cabinet) and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'. 

A Tempest unit appears in the music video 'Subdivisions' by RUSH. 

In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

		<name>Wild Fang / Tecmo Knight </name>
		<desc>Wild Fang is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players with a medieval setting. Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups.

The player's character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player's command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time.

The player's life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player's mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.
